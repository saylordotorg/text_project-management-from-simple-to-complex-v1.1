        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s07_s04_p01">The relationship between the project and its suppliers and vendors involves trust that both parties will keep their financial commitments. This trust may be based on past experience, but it can also be based on a third partyâ€™s rating of the financial health of the organization and its past behavior. For example, organizations with better credit ratings can negotiate lower prices with suppliers and vendors because there is less risk. One of the most popular rating agencies is D&amp;B. In this exercise, you locate and review the types of financial reports that are available from D&amp;B.</p>

                <li>Add this web address to your browserâ€™s bookmarks or favorites in the Project Management folder.</li>
                <li>Capture a screen that shows the address in the Project Management folder in the favorites or bookmarks and then paste it into <em class="emphasis">Ch12DBStudentName.doc</em>.</li>
                <li>Scroll down the page to the D&amp;B Rating Interpretation table. The rating in the first column indicates the worth of the company, and the numbers 1 through 4 indicate its general credit worthiness, where 1 is high and 4 is low. For example, a rating of 1A-4 indicates a company with a worth between $500,000 and $749,999 with a low credit worthiness rating.</li>

Notice that companies with a score of 1 are estimated to have a probability of failure of .03 percent (3 per 10,000) of failing in the next twelve months, while a rating of 5 means a probability of failure of 4.7 percent (almost 1 in 20).</li>
