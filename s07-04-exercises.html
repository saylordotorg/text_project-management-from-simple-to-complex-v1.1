        <p class="para" id="fwk-38087-ch05_s04_p03">The exercises in this section are designed to promote exchange of information among students in the classroom or in an online discussion. The exercises are more open ended, which means that what you find might be completely different from what your classmates find, and you can all benefit by sharing what you have learned.</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="fwk-38087-ch05_s04_l02">
            <li>Describe a project where trust or distrust became a major factor in the success or failure of the project. Using the four kinds of trust described by Lindskold, explain how trust was formed or lost. Consider the descriptions offered by other students of their trust experiences and identify a situation where one of the same types of trust was established or lost. Compare the effects on both projects.</li>
            <li>Describe a project where differences in culture affected communications, negotiations, or decision making.</li>
