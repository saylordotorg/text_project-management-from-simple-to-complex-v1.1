    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch08_p01">The project scope identifies the objectives of the project, what activities will be performed, and some of the activities that are not included in the project. The scope document is used to create a master schedule that identifies important dates and activities. In this chapter, the student learns how the scope and schedule are developed.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch08_p02">Project planning and scheduling is both an art and a science. No two project managers or planning professionals develop identical plans or project schedules. The planning process is creative and reflects the planner’s approach and style. Even though the project plan is unique to the approach and style of the planner, methods for developing the schedule and documenting the resulting plan follow certain rules.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch08_p03">On larger and more complex projects, a planning function composed of a small team of planning and scheduling experts may be needed to develop and track the project schedule. Project planners facilitate the development of the information required to develop the project plan using templates, past or similar projects, and most importantly, the thoughts and plans of the project team leaders and members. On a smaller project, the project manager may be responsible for accomplishing this planning function.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch08_p04">After gathering this information, the planner begins developing the project’s <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">master schedule</a><span class="glossdef">Schedule with key dates and activities.</span></span>—a summary level schedule that encompasses the entire project scope—that includes major events and provides a view of the entire project. Working with the project team, the planning continues to include more details as additional information becomes available. The schedule continues to evolve during the life of the project, and major revisions may be necessary in response to events both inside and outside the project that change critical dates on the schedule.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch08_p05">Determining the schedule of activities that comprise the project is a key element of project management.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch08_s02_p02">The list of activities, their relationship to each other, and estimates of durations and required resources comprise the work breakdown structure (WBS). The project WBS is a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">hierarchical</a><span class="glossdef">Classified according to criteria into successive levels.</span></span>—classified according to criteria into successive levels—listing and grouping of the project activities required to produce the deliverables of the project. The WBS represents a breakdown of the project into components that encompass the entire scope of the project. Each level of the WBS hierarchy represents a more detailed description of the project work so that the highest level represents broad categories, and the lower levels represent increasing amounts of detail.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch08_s02_p03">Larger and more complex projects often require a larger WBS. The size of the WBS is directly related to the amount of work on the project and how that work is divided into work packages. The WBS can be developed around the project phases or the project units or functions that will be performing the work. A WBS organized around the project phases facilitates the understanding of the amount of work required for each phase of the project. A WBS developed around the project units or functions of the project facilitates the understanding of the amount of work required for each function.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch08_s02_p04">The following example, named John’s move, has a low level of complexity compared to a larger project. Normally, this project would not receive the amount of detailed planning described in the following examples, but the authors chose to use a basic project that is familiar to most students to help them focus on learning the new concepts.</p>

He has accepted a job in Atlanta and now has to move from Chicago to Atlanta and be there, ready to work, right after the Christmas holidays. If the furniture arrives in good condition at least two days before John starts work, and for less than Five thousand dollars, the project will be a success. The move to Chicago five years ago cost five thousand dollars, but John is smarter now and will use his friends to help, so he is confident he can stay within budget.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch08_s02_p06">Developing a WBS begins by defining and developing lists of all <em class="emphasis">activities</em>—work performed on the project that consumes project resources, including cost and time—needed to accomplish the work of the project. The first draft of the WBS includes activities at the highest level of the hierarchy or the management level and typically includes the major activities or summary activities required to accomplish the deliverables identified in the project scope of work.</p>

        <p class="para" id="fwk-38087-ch08_s02_p07">On John’s move project, these top-level activities are numbered 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and so on. For example, a plan for the move is the major deliverable from 1.0 Plan Move, as shown below.</p>

The 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 numbers are the first subdivision of the work. For example, one of John’s Summary Level Activities is Packing (3.0). Although some minor packing (delicate items: 2.4) are packed under another summary activity, 3.3 is the major packing and includes the coordination and support of labor (friends Dion and Carlita). The activity is then decomposed—separated into basic elements—to the next level by listing the individual rooms that need packed, as shown below.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-38087-ch08_s02_p09">The WBS could be decomposed further to a greater level of detail by listing the tasks needed for each activity. For example activity 3.3.3, Pack Bedroom, can be decomposed into additional tasks, such as 3.3.3.1 Pack Closet, 3.3.3.2 Pack Drawers, and 3.3.3.3 Pack Blankets. This type of numbering of the activities is called intelligent numbering. In intelligent numbering, the numbering system has meaning so that a member of the project team knows something about the activity by the number of the activity. For example, any activity associated with packing begins with a 3; even picking up donuts can be an activity that supports packing. The donuts are a form of payment for the labor of Dion and Carlita.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch08_s02_p10">The WBS is developed or decomposed to the level that the manager needs to control or manage the project. Typically, larger and more complex projects require a more detailed WBS.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Estimation of Duration</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch08_s02_s01_p01">After the project team has created the WBS, each activity is reviewed and evaluated to determine the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">duration</a><span class="glossdef">Time from beginning to end of an activity.</span></span> (how long it will take to accomplish from beginning to end) and what <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">resources</a><span class="glossdef">Time and materials.</span></span> (time, materials, facilities, and equipment) are needed. An estimate is an educated guess based on knowledge, experience, and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">inference</a><span class="glossdef">Process of deriving conclusions based on assumptions.</span></span>—the process of deriving conclusions based on assumptions. The accuracy of the estimate is related to the quality of the knowledge and how that knowledge is applied. The person with the most knowledge may not be the most objective person to provide duration estimates. The person responsible for the work may also want to build in extra time. Multiple inputs into the duration estimate and a more detailed WBS help reduce bias—the making of decisions based on a prejudged perspective.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch08_s02_s01_p02">The unit of time used to develop the activity duration is a function of the level of detail needed by the user of the schedule. The larger and more complex the project, the greater the need for detail, which usually translates into shorter durations for activities.</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch08_s02_s01_n01">

            <p class="para" id="fwk-38087-ch08_s02_s01_p03">On a new plant start-up, the plant manager may need to know when the new employees will start training, when they will be fully trained, and when they can begin working in the plant. The plant human resources manager may need to know what skills workers need and how much time each training class will take. The schedule detail the HR manager needs will include activities to locate facilities, schedule training, write contracts for trainers, and manage the initiation of training classes. The trainer will need an even greater level of detail, which could be measured in days or even hours.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch08_s02_s01_p04">On our John’s move example, the project schedule may have been just as effective without detailing the packing of the individual rooms in the old apartment. If we deleted these items, would John know when he needed to pack each one of these rooms? If the answer is yes, then we may not need that level of detail.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch08_s02_s01_p05">The activity duration is the length of time the activity should take to complete from beginning to end. The unit of duration is typically working days but could include other units of time such as hours, weeks, or months. The unit chosen should be used consistently throughout the schedule.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch08_s02_s01_p06">An important event, such as a ground-breaking ceremony or receipt of occupancy from the building inspector, is called a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">milestone</a><span class="glossdef">An important point in a project without duration or resources.</span></span>.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch08_s02_s02_p01">A common resource constraint is availability. To consider the availability of team members, consultants, and key pieces of equipment, you can create a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">resource calendar</a><span class="glossdef">Calendar that indicates working days and days off for a group or individual.</span></span> for each that indicates which days are available and which are days off for a group, an individual, or a project asset such as a piece of important equipment. A calendar for team members from the same company could be the company calendar that shows working days, weekend days, and holidays. Individual team members can have individual calendars that show their vacation days or other days off, such as parental leave days. If major pieces of equipment are only available for certain periods of time, they can be given a resource calendar. Resource calendars become important tools when changes must be made to the schedule. When a resource calendar is applied to a duration estimate, the duration in days is distributed across the available calendar days. For example, if the duration is three days and the start date of the activity is Thursday, the activity would begin on Thursday and end on Monday of the following week, assuming the resource calendar shows that the person has the weekend off. If the weekend included an extra day off for a holiday like Labor Day, shown in the calendar in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-38087-ch08_s02_s02_f01">Figure 8.6</a>, the completion day of the same three-day activity would be pushed to Tuesday.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch08_s04_s01_p01">Tracking the schedule performance involves measuring the work performed against the work expected to be performed with a given expenditure of resources. Periodic reporting on the progress of the project provides the project management team with information on how the project is performing against expectations and to make decisions and corrections. Accurate measurement of schedule performance requires planning during the early stages of the project to determine the unit of measure and process for tracking progress.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch08_s04_s01_s01_p01">To determine the percentage of a project that has been completed, the project manager must determine what to measure. Some percentages are misleading. For example, a project that has completed 25 percent of the scheduled activities does not mean that the project is 25 percent complete. In our John’s move example, four rooms were to be packed. After the bedroom was packed, packing was not 25 percent complete. The kitchen contained five times as many items and required more delicate, time-consuming packing. John estimated that 40 percent of the items to be packed were in the kitchen, 20 percent in the living room, 20 percent in the bedroom, and the remaining 20 percent in miscellaneous locations. If the unit of measure for these activities is items packed, the packing is only 20 percent complete instead of 25 percent if rooms are the unit of measure.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch08_s04_s01_s01_p02">The unit of measure for tracking schedule progress is related to the estimate. If hours of labor are used as the unit of measure, the percentage of packing is even less because more time is estimated to pack each item in the kitchen. As the project management team estimates the duration for each activity, the amount of work to accomplish the tasks is captured in both resources expended and a unit of measure for tracking progress. The unit of measure is related to the type of project. On a software development project, the unit of measure may be lines of code written. The unit of measure that is chosen can affect the quality of the work.</p>

On complex projects, focusing on the milestones is useful for communicating important dates to the entire project team. Project team members can then adjust their efforts to complete the activities connected to the milestone events.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch08_s04_s01_s02_p02">Many project leaders believe that time lost on early activities can be made up toward the end of the project. Hard decisions about paying overtime and working weekends are often delayed until the end of the project when the pressure to complete the project on time becomes much stronger. Project managers who focus on milestone events create a sense of urgency to meet the milestone deadlines and spread the urgency to complete the project over the life of the project. Projects that meet milestone dates are more likely to meet project completion dates.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch08_s04_s02_p01">The schedule of activities is constrained by the availability of resources. If you apply the resource calendar to each activity to be sure the people and equipment are available on those dates, you can still miss an important constraint. If there are several activities that use a particular person’s time on the same days, that person could end up with too many activities scheduled for the same days and very little on other days. If key people are overloaded, the activities to which they are assigned might not be completed on time.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch08_s04_s03_s03_p01">The unit cost of work to be performed on a project is calculated at the beginning of the project based on the execution strategy of the project to meet the project completion date. If the project completion date is moved up, then the unit cost of work will likely increase. Conversely, a project team may be able to save money by extending the project end date. With more time, the project team may be able to schedule activities in such a way to reduce their costs. For example, an activity requiring overtime to be paid can now pay the labor at normal rates, saving the overtime premium. Changing elements of the master schedule means a change in scope. Scope changes often affect costs and require agreement by the parties who signed the original scope documents.</p>

To speed up the installation of the heating and cooling equipment, it was decided to make the zones of control larger, which meant that each floor would have fewer points where temperature was sensed and controlled and fewer air flow control boxes. The contract did not specify the zone size or how many control points were required on each floor of the building, so this change did not require a change in scope. As a result, when the sun is coming in on the south side of the building, those rooms get as much heat or cooling as the rooms on the north side, so they are often too hot. If the single temperature controller on each floor is set to a lower temperature, the rooms on the north side are too cold. The client for the building did not realize this change had been made until they were in the building for several months and the project was completed.</p>
