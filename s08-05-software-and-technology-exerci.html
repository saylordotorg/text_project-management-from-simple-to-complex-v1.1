            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch06_s05_s01_s02_p02">Wired telephones are connected physically to a local switch that can handle up to ten thousand connections represented by the last four-digit numbers in a telephone number from 0000 to 9999. Each switch is identified by a three-digit number such as 555. A local telephone number consists of the switch number and one of the ten thousand four-digit numbers such as 555 0112. This system can provide up to ten million different unique phone numbers,<span class="footnote" id="preston_2.0-6.5.xml-fnpreston_2.0-6.5.xml_001">The three-digit area code plus the next four digits make up a seven-digit number. A seven-digit number has ten million possible combinations from 000 0000 to 999 9999. In practice, some area codes are reserved for special purposes such as trouble-shooting, emergencies, directory assistance, and maintenance, so the maximum is less than ten million per area code. For example, numbers 555-0100 through 555-0199 are reserved for fictional use and are not assigned to real customers.</span>
 but it does not have the capacity to provide service to billions of people.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch06_s05_s01_s02_p03">The switches are grouped into areas and assigned a group number or area code. Area codes in North America were assigned at a time when numbers were converted to a sequence of electrical pulses by inserting your finger in a rotary disc—the dial—and pulling it to a stop on a phone like the one shown in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-38087-ch06_s05_s01_s02_f01">Figure 6.29 "Rotary Dial Telephone"</a>.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch06_s05_s01_s02_p04">As a spring returns the dial to its original position, it opens and closes a set of electrical contacts to create a series of pulses that match the number dialed. Because it takes longer to dial higher numbers like 8 or 9, area codes that could be dialed quickly like 212 and 213 were assigned to densely populated areas like Manhattan (212) and Los Angeles (213). Higher numbers were assigned to rural areas or to newer areas. As a result, it is difficult to determine where a telephone is located by its area code. Do not assume that numbers with similar area codes in North America are located in the same time zone—they may be thousands of miles apart. To initiate a call to a different area code, the number 1 is dialed first. This is the national direct dialing (NDD) code for NANP members.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch06_s05_s01_s03_p02">To make an international call from an NANP member such as the United States to another country, you need to provide two codes: the international direct dialing (IDD) code and the country code. The IDD code for the United States is 011. For example, if you wanted to place a call to a number in Rio de Janeiro, you would enter 011 55 21 xxx xxxx, where 011 is the IDD code for the United States, 55 is the country code for Brazil, 21 is the area code for Rio de Janeiro, and xxx xxxx represents the final seven digits of the number.</p>

In Brazil, there is a different code for each of the five phone companies. The IDD for Brasil Telecom is 0014.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch06_s05_s01_s04_p03">The IDD and the country code are not simply reversible.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch06_s05_s01_s05_p01">It is commonly understood in the United States that you do not enter the hyphens, parentheses, spaces, or periods that are used to make a telephone number more readable and that you dial 1 first—even though it is not included—for a call destined for a different area code. For example, if the phone number on the business card shows (555) 222-1111, you know that you would enter 2221111 if you are calling from within the 555 area code<span class="footnote" id="preston_2.0-6.5.xml-fnpreston_2.0-6.5.xml_002">Some area codes cover large geographic areas, and the NDD code is required to dial a number from within the same area code if they are far apart.</span>
 or 15552221111 for a call from a different area code, but you would not attempt to enter the parentheses, space, or hyphen. Spaces are used in some instances in the following discussion to make the numbers easier to read in this text, but it will be understood that they are not entered when dialing the number.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch06_s05_s01_s06_p01">Unlike those countries participating in the NANP, other countries use different numbers for the national direct dialing (NDD) code and the country code. They might use a different number of digits for the area or city code. A business card from a team member in Rio de Janeiro might be +55 (0)21-xxxx xxxx where 55 is the country code and 0 is the NDD code. To call this team member from the United States on a wired telephone, you would enter 011 55 21 xxxx xxxx, where 011 is the IDD for the United States, 55 is the country code for Brazil, and 21 is the code for Rio de Janeiro.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch06_s05_s01_s06_p02">Notice the zero between 55 and 21 is not included when calling from outside the country. This is the NDD code that is used for calls between areas within the country. For example, if you land in the airport at Sao Paulo, Brazil, and want to call the person in Rio de Janeiro from a local phone, you would enter 0 21 xxxx xxxx (without the spaces) where 0 is the NDD code—like 1 in the United States—and 21 is the area/city code.</p>
