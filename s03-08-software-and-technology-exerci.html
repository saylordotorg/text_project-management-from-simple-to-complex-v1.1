        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch01_s08_s01_p01">There are many programs that are useful for project managers that can be downloaded from a website. Some of them are free while others are trial versions or are available for a license fee. To download and install software on a computer, you must have administrative rights on that computer. If you are trying to use a computer at a company for your homework in this class, you probably do not have administrative rights to install software. You need to use a private computer on which you can log in as the administrator or as a user with rights to install software.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch01_s08_s01_p02">Alternatively, in some campus computer labs you are allowed to install software, but the computer is refreshed to its original configuration when the machine is restarted. If you use a computer in a common lab, be sure to complete the assignment before the machine is restarted.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch01_s08_s01_p03">In this exercise, you download and install Adobe Reader. This program allows you to read files that are saved in the PDF format. This format is very popular because it allows distribution of documents that may be easily viewed but not changed.</p>
