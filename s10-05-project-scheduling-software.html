            <li>Describe the relationship between the choice of software and project complexity.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch08_s05_p01">Low-complexity projects can be managed with lists of activities on paper or by using an outline in word processing or spreadsheet software. This software is inadequate for tracking complex projects. Fortunately, there are several dedicated software programs that keep track of the complex relationships between activities and resources.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-38087-ch08_s05_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Appropriate to Project Complexity</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch08_s05_s01_p01">Simple projects can be tracked using general purpose word processing and spreadsheet software like those available in Microsoft Office or OpenOffice. Medium-complexity projects benefit from dedicated project management software such as Microsoft Project and OpenProject. Complex projects require software that can track the interactions of thousands of tasks and produce sophisticated reports such as Oracle’s P6.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Features</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch08_s05_s02_p01">There are dozens of computer software programs available with a wide range of prices. Some open source software programs are free, but others cost up to a thousand dollars. There are several considerations for selecting a project management software besides price.</p>
        <div class="section" id="fwk-38087-ch08_s05_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Currently Used Software</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch08_s05_s02_s01_p01">Use software that is already in use and with which most team members are already familiar. If software that is used by most team members is appropriate to the complexity of your project, it is the default choice. It is also valuable to know what software is used by key vendors or project partners so files can be exchanged electronically in the same format.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch08_s05_s02_s02_p01">Any project management software that is selected must have the ability to track and display basic features such as the following:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch08_s05_s02_s02_l01">

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch08_s05_s02_s03_p01">Team members should be able to view the project schedule. Some software products require the use of expensive proprietary software that runs on the company’s server and that will allow several different team members to use the same schedule and restricts the use of the software to team members who have access to the company’s computer system. Other software products use a server on the Internet that is open to team members and vendors who have valid passwords.</p>

            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch08_s05_s02_s04_l01">
                <li>Issue tracking that tracks problems, actions, and resolutions</li>

                <li>Automatic resource leveling and alerts when a resource is overscheduled</li>
                <li>Document management feature that tracks contracts, bids, scope changes, and incidents</li>

If you wanted to require that all the members of your ten-person team use project management software that was new to all of them, how would you recommend that they learn the software?</p>
