        <p class="para" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s01_p03">A construction company has a contract to build a large building in downtown New York. Most, if not all, the construction materials, such as steel and concrete, will be purchased from companies that specialize in steel and concrete. Existing companies that produce and sell steel can provide the steel the project needs at a much lower cost and faster than if the project manager’s organization attempted to build the capacity itself.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s01_p04">Some outsourcing decisions—sometimes called make or buy decisions—are more difficult. On the same building construction project, new construction materials and methods are required that will make the building more energy efficient. The project manager can outsource this portion of the project to companies that have this expertise or develop this expertise on the project and self-perform the work. The costs of developing this expertise within the project will be more expensive and may take more time than outsourcing this work.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s01_p05">Self-performing this work also has benefits. The project team would develop this expertise and the additional expertise would add value to the parent company and save money on future projects. The project management team would have greater control over the work because the work would be performed by members of the project team instead of outsiders. Self-performing and outsourcing the work have both benefits and risks.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s01_p06">This decision is primarily influenced by the following:</p>

        <p class="para" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s01_p08">On the New York building construction project, the project manager decided to outsource the portion of the work that required new methods and materials. The project team assigned engineers from the project team to evaluate the work during the project and to assess the appropriate methods and costs for the parent company to develop this capacity within the company. The additional costs of developing the capacity and the additional risks of implementing a new method with existing resources outweighed the benefits of developing the capacity within the organization.</p>

The decision to self-perform this portion of the work was easy because the company had a cost and schedule advantage by using the existing resources. The purchase of the steel, concrete, and other commodities was also easy because the costs of developing those resources far outweighed the benefit of purchasing them.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s02_p02">The method of purchasing products or services depends on the uniqueness and importance of the product or service. One way to organize the procurement plan is by the type of relationship with the providers of the outsourced goods or services.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Suppliers</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s02_s01_p01">Some of the goods or services are commonly available with little variation in quality or availability. Such goods and services are called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">commodities</a><span class="glossdef">Items that can be bought off the shelf with no special modification for the project.</span></span>. The providers of commodities are <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">suppliers</a><span class="glossdef">Source of commodities.</span></span> and there are usually several from which to choose. Purchasing commodities from suppliers focuses on achieving the lowest cost. Cost of commodities can often be found in the supplier’s catalog. On smaller, less complex projects, supplies can be purchased as needed from the supplier’s catalog.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s02_s01_p02">Additional cost savings are often available if large quantities of a commodity are purchased from the same supplier. On larger, more complex projects, a list of materials and supplies is developed from the project cost estimate. This list is provided to suppliers as a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">request for quote (RFQ)</a><span class="glossdef">Requires a bidder to provide a price and additional information for a defined scope of work.</span></span>, and the suppliers respond with their lowest price. To avoid choosing a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">bid</a><span class="glossdef">An offer to provide something of value for compensation. A bid can be written or verbal and can be in response to a solicitation or unsolicited.</span></span> from a company that will make a promise it cannot keep, many organizations will maintain a list of suppliers that meet the organization’s requirements. These requirements usually include the proven ability to meet the quality and schedule specifications.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s02_s01_p03">The project management team develops a procedure for requesting a quote. On smaller projects, the parent purchasing organization may process all RFQs. On larger projects, a procurement organization is established with expertise in purchasing. The purchasing team will develop a list of all procurement requirements for the project and develop a procurement schedule that assures the materials will be available to the project when needed.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s02_s01_p04">The project team develops an RFQ based on the quantity and schedule needs of the project and sends the RFQ to the identified qualified suppliers. The suppliers then develop a quote that lists the specific materials to be provided, the price for each, and a schedule for delivery. The project team evaluates each quote from suppliers and determines that the supplier bid meets all the requirements, and in most cases, the supplier with the lowest price will be awarded the bid.</p>

            <h3 class="title">RFQ for Housing Contractor</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s02_s01_p05">A housing contractor who is building ten identical houses develops a materials list that includes all the carpentry, plumbing, and electrical supplies needed to build all ten houses. The housing contractor develops an RFQ for all these materials, including the construction schedule, and submits the RFQ to the four largest building supply companies in the region. Each of the supply companies decides to bid on the project and provides a bid for the materials in the RFQ. One of the bidders has the lowest price but is unable to deliver the materials to the job site. The project team calculates the cost of transporting the materials to the job site. After the cost of transportation is added to the bid, it is no longer the lowest total cost. The bidder with the total lowest total cost is awarded the contract.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s02_s01_p06">Some organizations that do a large number of projects will develop a relationship with one or two suppliers based on developing cost savings for both organizations. This relationship is commonly called a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">key supplier</a><span class="glossdef">A person or organization supplying goods or services to the project that has a special relationship with the project or parent organization and might bypass the bidding process.</span></span> relationship.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s02_s01_p07">The housing contractor develops a key supplier relationship with one or two of the building supply companies. The building supply company would guarantee a 10 percent discount on all materials and the contractor would promise to purchase exclusively from the key supplier. Both organizations save the cost and time associated with preparing the bid. The building supply company plans on a consistent volume of business from the contractor and the contractor can expect priority treatment when supplies are scarce.</p>

The vendor typically provides a product or service that is designed for the project. The following are examples of products or services provided by vendors:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s02_s02_l01">
            <li>A large military contract to design and build a new fighter aircraft</li>

        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s02_s02_p02">Products and services from vendors need input and insight from the vendor. Instead of issuing a request for quote (RFQ) for a list of commodities, the project team issues a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">request for proposal (RFP)</a><span class="glossdef">Requires a bidder to offer solutions and ideas on how to perform the scope of work and a price for performing that work.</span></span>. Companies responding to an RFP are invited to provide creative approaches to adding value to the project. Bidders are encouraged to offer design alternatives, alternative uses of materials, and scheduling alternatives that meet all the project requirements and also reduce the total project cost. The bids are evaluated on the total value to the project, including the contribution to the project goals.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s02_s02_p03">A copper mining project in Argentina included the design and construction of the mine site, the extraction of copper from the raw materials, the building of a pipeline to transport the copper ore to the Atlantic coast, and the construction of a port to enable the loading of the copper ore into various size ships. The construction materials, such as lumber, steel, and concrete, were purchased through suppliers, including key suppliers.</p>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s02_s02_p04">Some of the equipment used to extract the copper ore from the raw materials costs several million dollars and is only fabricated by a few companies. The project team designs the equipment to meet characteristics of the mining environment in Argentina: size, hardness, and composition of the raw material. The bid documents sent to the mining equipment vendors included the design specification and performance specification of the equipment, the project schedule, and the mining process. A request for proposal (RFP) was issued to each of the vendors.</p>
        </div>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s02_s02_p05">Because vendor performance is critical to the success of the project, the management of the vendor relationship is a project management priority. Project management will often implement processes that encourage the vendors to submit suggestions that will reduce total project cost, shorten the schedule, or improve the performance. The project management team will often assign someone from the team to monitor the relationship and provide support from project resources to help assure vendor success.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s02_s03_p02">In the Argentina mining project example, the United States parent organization had project management, engineering, procurement, construction, and mining technology expertise. The company also had relationships with major mining equipment vendors. The U.S. construction company partnered with an Argentinean company that had expertise and relationships important to the success of the project.</p>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s02_s03_p03">The Argentinean company contributed local knowledge of the construction workforce; local engineering and construction practices, knowledge, and expertise in the government permitting processes; and an existing relationship with potential key suppliers and local vendors.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s02_s03_p04">A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">partnership</a><span class="glossdef">Formal arrangement to execute the project with each party contributing resources.</span></span> is a formal arrangement to execute the project with each party contributing resources. In most partnerships, both parties benefit from the success of the project and share the costs associated with a less successful project. Critical to the success of a partnership is the clear definition of roles and responsibilities on the project, a common understanding of the project goals, and a scope of work for each partner.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s02_s03_p05">Building the relationship between major partners on the project is similar to building relationships with clients. On a large, complex project, a partnership alignment session is often required to build the trust required for open communication channels. Maintaining the relationship permits more effective problem solving and coordinated action on the project. A well-managed partnering relationship can contribute to the achievement of project goals, reduce overall costs, and shorten the project schedule. In most cases, the parent organization is aware of weaknesses in the project resources or skills and searches for a potential partner that has the needed resources or skills. In our Argentinean example, the parent company knew that construction experience in Argentina would be important to a successful project. Both companies will research the capability of the other company to assure that the partnership is appropriate for both companies.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s02_s03_p06">On a project to build a new biotech plant in Puerto Rico, a large engineering and construction company selected a Puerto Rican civil engineering company to design the site work on the project. Because the plant was needed quickly, the project schedule was an important component of every discussion and meeting the project end date was a major goal. The Puerto Rican Company was asked to begin developing the civil drawings early, before much of the needed information had been developed. This was a situation where a partnering relationship would benefit the project. Both companies would mutually support each other to achieve project goals and both would benefit from project success.</p>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s02_s03_p07">In this situation, the project procurement plan specified the development of a subcontract for the civil engineering, and a contract was developed with a clear scope of work and a cost based on completing the work in the contract on time and according to specification. Because the aggressive project schedule required the civil engineering company to begin work before all the needed information was available, change orders were required when new information became available. The contract allowed several days to evaluate the impact of the change on cost and schedule, and the time evaluation process began to cause delays in the project.</p>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s02_s03_p08">Eventually, a new contract was developed to make the Puerto Rican company a partner. These new partnering arrangements allowed the engineers to get early information and contribute ideas that would shorten the schedule. This case is an example of the need to evaluate the project goals and environment and develop a procurement strategy that matches the conditions of the project.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s03_p01">An agreement between the organization and an outside provider of a service or materials is a legal <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">contract</a><span class="glossdef">An agreement that is legally enforceable.</span></span>. To limit misunderstandings and make them more enforceable, contracts are usually written documents that describe the obligations of both parties.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s03_p02">Because legal agreements often create risk for the parent organization, procurement activities are often guided by the policies and procedures of the parent organization. After the project management team develops an understanding of what portions of the project work will be outsourced and defines the type of relationships that are needed to support the project execution plan, the procurement team begins to develop the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">contracting plan</a><span class="glossdef">Defines the relationship between the project and the subcontractors—supplier, vendor, or partner—and also defines a process for making changes in the agreement.</span></span>. On smaller, less complex projects, the contract development and execution is typically managed through the parent company or by a part-time person assigned to the project. On larger, more complex projects, the procurement team can consist of work teams within the procurement function with special expertise in contracting. The contract plan defines the relationship between the project and the subcontractors (supplier, vendor, or partner) and also defines a process for making changes in the agreement to accommodate changes that will occur on the project. This change management process is similar to the change management process used with the project agreement with the project client.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s03_p03">The contracting plan of the project supports the procurement approach of the project. The following are some factors to consider when selecting the type of contract:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s03_l02">
        <li>The uncertainty of the scope of work needed</li>
        <li>The party assuming the risk of unexpected cost increases</li>
        <li>The importance of meeting the scheduled milestone dates</li>
        <li>The need for predictable project costs</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s03_p04">There are several types of contracting approaches and each supports different project environments and project approaches. The legal contracts that support the procurement plan consist of two general types of contract: the fixed price and the cost reimbursable contracts, with variations on each main type.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Fixed Price Contracts</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s03_s01_p01">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">fixed price contract</a><span class="glossdef">A type of contract that pays a contractor an amount that is agreed upon at the start of the project.</span></span> is a legal agreement between the project organization and an entity (person or company) to provide goods or services to the project at an agreed-on price. The contract usually details the quality of the goods or services, the timing needed to support the project, and the price for delivering goods or services. There are several variations of the fixed price contract. For commodities and goods and services where the scope of work is very clear and not likely to change, the fixed price contract offers a predictable cost. The responsibility for managing the work to meet the needs of the project is focused on the contractor. The project team tracks the quality and schedule progress to assure the contractors will meet the project needs. The risks associated with fixed price contracts are the costs associated with project change. If a change occurs on the project that requires a change order from the contractor, the price of the change is typically very high. Even when the price for changes is included in the original contract, changes on a fixed price contract will create higher total project costs than other forms of contracts because the majority of the cost risk is transferred to the contractor, and most contractors will add a contingency to the contract to cover their additional risk.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s03_s01_p02">Fixed price contracts require the availability of at least two or more suppliers that have the qualifications and performance histories that assure the needs of the project can be met. The other requirement is a scope of work that is most likely not going to change. Developing a clear scope of work based on good information, creating a list of highly qualified bidders, and developing a clear contract that reflects that scope of work are critical aspects of a good fixed priced contract.</p>

The most common use of this type of contract is the inflation-adjusted price. In some countries, the value of its local currency can vary greatly in a few months, which affects the cost of local materials and labor. In periods of high inflation, the client assumes risk of higher costs due to inflation, and the contract price is adjusted based on an inflation index. The volatility of certain commodities can also be accounted for in a price adjustment contract. For example, if the price of oil significantly affects the costs of the project, the client can accept the oil price volatility risk and include a provision in the contract that would allow the contract price adjustment based on a change in the price of oil.</p>

The contract might include an incentive for completing the work on an important milestone for the project. Often contracts have a penalty clause if the work is not performed according to the contract. For example, if the new software is not completed in time to support the start-up of a new plant, the contract might penalize the software company a daily amount of money for every day the software is late. This type of penalty is often used when the software is critical to the project and the delay will cost the project significant money.</p>

The project uses a cost reimbursable contract to pay the contractor for allowable expenses related to performing the work. Since the cost of the project is reimbursable, the contractor has much less risk associated with cost increases. When the costs of the work are not well known, a cost reimbursable contract reduces the amount of money the bidders place in the bid to account for the risk associated with potential increases in costs.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s03_s02_p02">The contractor is also less motivated to find ways to reduce the cost of the project unless there are incentives for supporting the accomplishment of project goals.

                <p class="para" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s03_s02_s05_p04">On a road construction project, the survey team discovers an archeological site. Contractors are required to preserve archeological sites and the project team explores ways to advance the schedule while a decision is made on how to handle the site. The project issues a T&amp;M contract to an archeologist to determine the nature of the site and develop a plan to preserve the integrity of the site. A T&amp;M contract is awarded because the size and character of the site is unknown and the amount of time and the type of equipment needed to explore the site is also unknown.</p>
                <p class="para" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s03_s02_s05_p05">An archeologist from the local university was issued a T&amp;M contract to cover the labor and expenses to explore the site and develop a plan. An hourly rate was established for each member of the five-person archeological team. Equipment rental fees plus 15 percent was paid on all equipment rented and supplies used. The archeological team’s profit was incorporated into the labor rates.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Progress Payments and Change Management</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s03_s03_p01">Vendors and suppliers usually require payments during the life of the contract. On contracts that last several months, the contractor will incur significant cost and will want the project to pay for these costs as early as possible. Rather than wait until the end of the contract, a schedule of payments is typically developed as part of the contract and is connected to the completion of a defined amount of work or project milestones. These payments made before the end of the project and based on the progress of the work are called progress payments. For example, a concrete supplier on a construction project may bill the contract for the amount of concrete poured the previous month plus the profit earned during that period. On a training project, the contract might develop a payment schedule that pays for the development of the curriculum, and payment is made when the curriculum is completed and accepted. In each case, there is a defined amount of work to be accomplished, a time frame for accomplishing that work, and a quality standard the work must achieve before the contractor is paid for the work.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s03_s03_p02">Just as the project has a scope of work that defines what is included in the project and what work is outside the project, vendors and suppliers have a scope of work that defines what they will produce or supply to the company. (Partners typically share the project scope of work and may not have a separate scope of work.) Often changes occur on the project that require changes in the contractor’s scope of work. How these changes will be managed during the life of the project is typically documented in the contract. Capturing these changes early, documenting what changed and how the change impacted the contract, and developing a change order (a change to the contract) are important to maintaining the progress of the project. Conflict among team members will often arise when changes are not documented or when the team cannot agree on the change. Developing and implementing an effective change management process for contractors and key suppliers will minimize this conflict and the potential negative effect on the project.</p>

                <li>Contract selection is based on uncertainty of scope, assignment of risk, need for predictable costs, and the importance of meeting milestone dates.</li>
                <li>Total fixed cost is a single price where the scope is well defined. A fixed price with incentive contract offers a reward for finishing early or under budget or a penalty for being late. A fixed price with adjustment allows for increases in cost of materials or changes in currency values. A fixed unit price contract sets a price per unit, but the exact number of units is not known.</li>
                <li>In a cost reimbursable contract, the project pays for costs. A cost plus fixed fee contract assures the contractor of a known fee. A cost plus percentage fee calculates the fee as a percentage of the costs. A cost plus incentive fee sets goals for the contractor to achieve that would result in a bonus. A cost plus award fee is similar, but the goals are more subjective. Time and materials contracts pay for costs plus an hourly rate for the contractor’s time.</li>

Each of these steps is also included in the project master schedule. The time involved in the procurement cycle can influence the scheduling of critical activities, including the decision to self-perform the work or contract the work to others.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s04_s02_p01">The technical teams typically develop a description of the work that will be outsourced. From this information, the project management team answers the following questions:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s04_s02_l01">
            <li>Is the required work or materials a commodity, customized product or service, or unique skill or relationship?</li>
            <li>What type of relationship is needed: supplier, vendor, or partnership?</li>
            <li>How should the supplier, vendor, or potential partner be approached: RFQ, RFP, or personal contact?</li>
            <li>How well known is the scope of work?</li>
            <li>What are the risks and which party should assume which types of risk?</li>
            <li>Does the procurement of the service or goods affect activities on the project schedule’s critical path and how much float is there on those activities?</li>
            <li>How important is it to be sure of the cost in advance?</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s04_s02_p02">The procurement team uses the answers to the first three questions listed above to determine the approach to obtaining the goods or services and the remaining questions to determine what type of contract is most appropriate.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s04_s02_p03">A key factor in selecting the contract approach is determining which party will take the most risk. The team determines the level of risk that will be managed by the project and what risks will be transferred to the contractor. Typically, the project management team wants to manage the project risk, but in some cases, contractors have more expertise or control that enable them to be better positioned to manage the risk associated with the contracted work.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s04_s03_s01_p01">Potential bidders are people or organizations capable of providing the materials or performing the work required for the project. On smaller, less complex projects, the parent company typically has a list of suppliers and vendors that have successfully provided goods and services in the past, and the project has access to the performance record of companies on that list. On unique projects, where no suppliers lists exist, the project team develops a list of potential suppliers and then qualifies them to become eligible to bid on project work. Eligible bidders are placed on the bidders list and provided with a schedule of when work on the project will be bid.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s04_s03_s01_p02">The eligibility of a supplier is determined by the ability to perform the work in a way that meets project requirements and demonstrates financial stability. Ability to perform the work includes the ability to meet quality specifications and meet the project schedule. During times when economic activity is high in a region, many suppliers become busy and stretch their resources. The project team investigates the potential suppliers to assure they have the capacity and the track record of meeting deadlines before they are included on the bidder’s list.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s04_s03_s01_p03">The potential supplier must also be financially stable to be included on the bidders list.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s04_s04_p01">Evaluation of bids in response to RFQs for commodity items and services is heavily graded for price. In most cases, the lowest total price will win the contract. The total price will include the costs of the goods or services, any shipping or delivery costs, the value of any warranties, and any additional service that adds value to the project.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s04_s04_p02">The evaluation of bids based on RFPs is more complex. The evaluation of proposals includes the price and also an evaluation of the technical approach chosen by the bidder. The project team evaluating the proposal must include people with the expertise to understand the technical aspects of the various proposal options and the value of each proposal to the project. On more complex projects, the administrative part of the proposal is evaluated and scored by one team, and the technical aspect of the proposal is evaluated by another team. The project team combines the two scores to determine the best proposal for the project.</p>

Less complex awards, like contracts for building materials, require a reading and signing of the contract to assure the building materials supplier understands the contract terms and requirements of the project schedule. More complex projects require a detailed discussion of the goals, the potential barriers to accomplishing those goals, the project schedule and critical dates for the contract to make, and the processes for resolving conflicts and improving work processes.</p>

The session then focused on developing ways to resolve problems and increase performance. Although this may appear to be a simple process of focusing contractors on project success, the process took several days of lengthy discussion and conflict resolution.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s04_s06_p01">The contract type determines the level of effort and the skills needed to manage the contract. The manager of supplier contracts develops detailed specifications and assures compliance to these specifications. The manager of vendor contracts assures the contractors that bid the work have the skills and capacity to accomplish the work according to the project schedule and tracks the vendor’s performance against the project needs, supplying support and direction when needed. The manager of partnering arrangements develops alignment around common goals and work processes. Each of these approaches requires different skills and various degrees of effort.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s04_s06_p02">Items that take a long time to acquire—<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">long lead items</a><span class="glossdef">Equipment or materials that will require a long time to acquire or build.</span></span>—receive early attention by the project leadership. Examples of long lead items are equipment that is designed and built specifically for the project, curriculum that is created for training a new workforce, and a customized bioreactor for a biotech project. These items might require weeks, months, and sometimes years to develop and deliver to the project site. Long lead items that are procured through the normal procurement cycle may cause delays in the project, and the project team identifies these items early to begin the procurement activities as soon as possible.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s04_s06_p03">After the contract is awarded, the project team tracks the performance of the contractor against performance criteria in the contract and his contribution to the performance of the project. Typically, the contractors deliver the product or service that meets the quality expectations and supports the project schedule. Typically, there are also one or two contractors that do not perform to project expectations. Some project managers will then pull out the contract and attempt to persuade the contractor to improve performance or be penalized. Other project managers will explore with the contractor creative ways to improve performance and meet project requirements. The contract management allows for both approaches to deal with nonperforming contractors and the project team must assess what method is most likely to work in each situation.</p>

The project team analyzed the situation and determined the vendor had taken on more work than it was capable of completing by the project’s required due dates. This was an important vendor to the project and any delay in delivery from the vendor meant a delay in the completion of the project.</p>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s04_s06_p05">The project manager and Eastman executives flew to the vendor’s plant in New Jersey and brought a large bar graph of the project schedule.

Eastman offered technical support to the team and resources from the project to expedite the delivery. During lunch, Eastman executives and managers from the project walked with the plant manager around the plant floor, talking with the skilled labor working on the equipment. Eastman managers left Eastman hats and other small gifts as tokens of appreciation for their effort in supporting the Eastman project.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s04_s06_s01_p01">Equipment and materials that are purchased for use on the project must be transported, inventoried, warehoused, and often secured. This area of expertise is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">logistics</a><span class="glossdef">Managing procurement, distribution, maintenance, and replacement of goods and services.</span></span>. The logistics for the project can be managed by the project team or can be included in the RFP or RFQ. On international projects, materials may be imported, and the procurement team manages the customs process. On smaller projects, the logistical function is often provided by the parent company. On larger projects, these activities are typically contracted to companies that specialize in logistical services. On larger, more complex projects, that procurement team will include logistical expertise.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s04_s06_s01_p02">The project work often depends on materials procured for the project. The delivery of these materials influences the scheduling of the project, and often some materials are needed earlier than normal procurement practices would deliver. On long lead items, the project schedule is included in the contracting plans and contractors must explain how they will support the project schedule.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s04_s06_s01_p03">On large, complex projects, critical items might be scheduled for delivery after they are needed on the project.

The contract can often place a priority on the fabrication of the equipment and delivery of the equipment to meet the project schedule. The project logistics team can also explore ways of shortening the transportation time. For example, a project in Argentina flew some critical equipment from Sweden rather than transport the equipment by ship to save several weeks in transit. The logistics costs were higher, but the overall value to the project was greater.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s05_s01_s02_p01">If a vendor is providing a service or building something for the project, there are usually items that must be fixed or mistakes that must be corrected before the contract is complete. On a software project, performance tests are run on the software, usually by the people who will be using the software, and any performance expectations not met are noted. Sometimes the expectations were not captured in the project scope of work and sometimes the performance did not meet the expectations established in the scope. If the items were not in the scope of work and the owner wants the work done, then the owner typically issues a change order. If the expectations were in the scope of work, the contractor is still responsible for completing the work.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s05_s01_s02_p02">On a project to build a new house, the owner might go through the house looking for minor items not completed by the contractor. Before the contract is closed, any minor items that need to be repaired or completed are placed on a punch list, which is a list of all the items found by the owner that still remain to be done. The project team will then work on all of the items on the list, building a small schedule to complete the remaining work.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s05_s01_s02_p03">If the number of items on the punch list is too large or the amount of work is significant, the project team continues to work the project.

They might perform their own inspection to determine if the project team has met its goals for quality and that all elements of the project are complete. These performance tests are typically identified in the original project contract.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s05_s01_s04_p01">The final payment is usually more than a simple percentage of the work that remains to be completed. Completing the project might involve fixing the most difficult problems that are disproportionately expensive to solve, so the final payment should be large enough to motivate the vendor to give the project a high priority so that the project can be completed on time.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s05_s01_s04_p02">If the supplier has met all the contractual obligations, including fixing problems and making repairs as noted on a punch list, the project team signs off on the contract and submits it to the accounting department for final payment. The supplier is notified that the last payment is final and completes the contractual agreement between the supplier and the project.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s05_s02_p01">Before the team is dissolved and begins to focus on the next project, a review is conducted to capture the lessons that can be learned from this project, often called a lessons learned meeting or document. The team explores what went well and captures the processes to understand why they went well. The team asks if the process is transferable to other projects. The team also explores what did not go well and what people learned from the experience. The process is not to find blame but to learn.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s05_s02_p02">Quality management is a process of continuous improvement that includes learning from past projects and making changes to improve the next project. This process is documented as evidence that quality management practices are in use. Some organizations have formal processes for changing work processes and integrating the lessons learned from the project so other projects can benefit. Some organizations are less formal in the approach and expect individuals to learn from the experience and take the experience to their next project and share what they learned with others in a very informal way.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s05_s02_s01_p01">One of the first activities was to create a project profile to determine where the challenges were most likely to occur. If the Darnall-Preston Complexity Index (DPCI) was used, each of the complexity evaluations is reviewed and compared to actual events that occurred during the project. The team explores the changes in the complexity level during the life of the project and how the team managed the complexity during the life of the project. Learning from this exercise develops expertise that is useful in making the next project profile. The DPCI rating is adjusted, if necessary, for reference purposes on future projects.</p>

Events that caused changes to the schedule are reviewed to see how the use of contingency reserves and float mitigated the disruption caused by those events. The original estimates of contingency time are reviewed to determine if they were adequate and the estimates of duration and float were accurate. These activities are necessary for the project team to develop expertise in estimating schedule elements in future projects—they are not used to place blame.</p>

Did events take place on the project that were unforeseen? What cues existed that may have allowed the team to predict these events? Was the project contingency sufficient to cover unforeseen risks? Even if nothing went wrong on this project, it is not proof that risk mitigation was a waste of money, but it is useful to compare the cost of avoiding risk versus the cost of unexpected events to understand how much it cost to avoid risk.</p>

The end of a major project is often a time to reflect. Project team members and stakeholders have typically invested a great deal of time and emotional energy into the success of the project. Because of this investment and because of the close relationships that develop during a project, project closure in often sad. Project managers stay tuned into the project team environment and use celebrations and team recognition to ameliorate the effects of project closure.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s05_s05_p02">This is an opportunity to improve client satisfaction and team member satisfaction. Awards or recognition plaques might be given out to individuals who made an outstanding contribution to the project. Celebrating and reviewing the challenges and successes of the project creates a positive memory of the project and reinforces the learning that can be transferred to future projects. Groups or teams can be recognized and instances where trust between team members made a positive difference can be rewarded.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s07_s04_p01">The relationship between the project and its suppliers and vendors involves trust that both parties will keep their financial commitments. This trust may be based on past experience, but it can also be based on a third party’s rating of the financial health of the organization and its past behavior. For example, organizations with better credit ratings can negotiate lower prices with suppliers and vendors because there is less risk. One of the most popular rating agencies is D&amp;B. In this exercise, you locate and review the types of financial reports that are available from D&amp;B.</p>

                <li>Add this web address to your browser’s bookmarks or favorites in the Project Management folder.</li>
                <li>Capture a screen that shows the address in the Project Management folder in the favorites or bookmarks and then paste it into <em class="emphasis">Ch12DBStudentName.doc</em>.</li>
                <li>Scroll down the page to the D&amp;B Rating Interpretation table. The rating in the first column indicates the worth of the company, and the numbers 1 through 4 indicate its general credit worthiness, where 1 is high and 4 is low. For example, a rating of 1A-4 indicates a company with a worth between $500,000 and $749,999 with a low credit worthiness rating.</li>

                <li>Scroll down to the US Employee Range Designation table. Notice this rating indicates the number of employees, where ER1 is more than 1,000.</li>

                <li>Scroll down to the D&amp;B PAYDEX Value table. Observe that the PAYDEX score indicates when the company pays its debts. Notice that paying off debts sooner than is contractually required earns a PAYDEX score above 80.</li>

                <li>Scroll down to the Financial Stress Score table. Notice that companies with a score of 1 are estimated to have a probability of failure of .03 percent (3 per 10,000) of failing in the next twelve months, while a rating of 5 means a probability of failure of 4.7 percent (almost 1 in 20).</li>
