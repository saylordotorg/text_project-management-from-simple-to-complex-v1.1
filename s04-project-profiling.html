    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch02_p01">A project profile provides a snapshot look at a project and provides valuable information in the development of the project execution plan and the assignment of resources to the project. An analysis of the project environment, including the internal and external environment, provides information that allows the project’s parent organization to allocate the organizational resources and assign the appropriate organizational leadership to the project. Most organizations have some form of project profiling process. Some simple processes consider the project size, technology, and location to develop the project profile. This chapter discusses different processes for profiling projects and discusses one method for developing a project profile based on the project’s complexity.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch02_s01_p01">A few years ago, I observed a project manager with a long list of successful projects absolutely struggle with a project. As I looked around, I noticed that often times project managers who do superb jobs on some projects will fail on others. What causes this to happen? Why were project managers successful on some projects but struggling on others?</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch02_s01_p02">Even though all projects are by definition unique, there are <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">attributes</a><span class="glossdef">Characteristic of an entity or object.</span></span> that are common among projects that allow the characterization or profiling of a project. We can look at just two project attributes and develop some understanding of the project. A large project that will be executed in at least three locations will have a very different profile from a small project that will be executed in one location. These two attributes—size and location—provide information about the project that will enable a manager in the parent organization to assign a project manager with the appropriate knowledge and skills. We can then develop an execution approach to increase the likelihood of success.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch02_s01_p03">Project managers have not always been assigned to projects based on their skills and the skills required by the project. Research by the Construction Industry Institute<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38087-fn02_001">Construction Industry Institute, “Executive Summary,” <em class="emphasis">RR103-11—Optimizing Project Organizations</em>, 2009, <a class="link" href="https://www.construction-institute.org/scriptcontent/more/rr103_11_more.cfm">https://www.construction-institute.org/scriptcontent/more/rr103_11_more.cfm</a> (accessed June 18, 2009).</span> indicated that the number one criterion for assignment of a project manager to a project was availability. Even if available, the ideal project manager for a large construction project may not be a good fit for a software development project. The technical knowledge needed to manage these projects is not the same and having the wrong technical knowledge may make the difference between a successful project and project failure.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch02_s01_p04">Even within the same industry, like the construction industry, different skills are needed by the project manager for different projects. For example, the construction of an office building in downtown Philadelphia is a very different project from the construction of a chemical plant in Mexico. The differences in these projects require different skills and different execution approaches. Organizations have not had good tools for understanding and matching the needs of a project with the project manager who has the right skills and experience. Developing a project profile is one method for developing an understanding of the project that will allow a systematic approach to developing an execution plan based on the profile of the project and selecting a project manager who has the right kind of experience and skills.</p>

The characterization will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the project that should result in developing an appropriate execution approach and the assignment of organizational resources. In different terms, project profiling is a process that summarizes what is known about the attributes of a project and places the project into a category with other projects that have similar characteristics. For example, you can characterize a project as a large project or a small project. The size of the project becomes the profiling attribute. You can characterize a project as domestic or global, and the location of the project becomes the profiling characteristic.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch02_s01_p06">A company that has twenty projects may determine that four of these projects are estimated to cost more than $1 million dollars and the remaining sixteen projects are estimated to cost much less. The company then communicates that all projects over $1 million be considered a large project. The company now establishes a rule that large projects will require a project manager with at least five years experience, it will have a vice president as executive sponsor, and it will require formal quarterly reports. In this example, one characteristic is used to develop the organization’s project management approach to their twenty projects.</p>

Shenhar and Dov Dvir, “Toward a Typological Theory of Project Management,” <em class="emphasis">Research Policy</em> 25 (1996): 607–32.</span> developed a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">typology</a><span class="glossdef">Classification or profiling of items that have characteristics or traits in common.</span></span>—classification or profile—of engineering projects that reflected two dimensions. The first dimension reflected the technological uncertainty and ranged from low tech, medium tech, and high tech to super high tech. Although projects involve the use of various levels of technology, Shenhar and Dvir develop criteria for each type of technological uncertainty that enabled the project to be typed. The second dimension reflected the system scope. The system scope dimension ranged from assembly projects that dealt with building a single component, to system projects that included interactive elements, to array projects that included a wide dispersal of interactive systems and subsystems.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch02_s02_p02">Shenhar and Dvir observed that the project execution approach was connected to the project type. The study identified different management patterns associated with project type as well as different management tools and practices. As the project system scope became more complex and the system scope of the project became larger, more sophisticated management tools were put in place to reduce project uncertainty. As project technology increased, project managers became more invested in processes to manage technical issues such as redesign and testing. As projects increased in system scope, project managers became more invested in formal planning and control issues. In later research, Shenhar<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38087-fn02_003">Aaron J. Shenhar, <em class="emphasis">Adapting Your Project Management Style: The Key to Project Success</em> (Hoboken, NJ: Stevens Institute of Technology, 1999).</span> developed recommendations for adjusting the project management approach based on the project typology—systematic classification or profile. For example, project managers will use more risk management techniques (see <a class="xref" href="fwk-38087-ch11#fwk-38087-ch11">Chapter 11 "Managing Project Risk"</a> on risk management) when the technological uncertainty is high.</p>

Among the attributes he used were the uncertainty and risk, level of sophistication of the workers, the level of detail in the planning, the newness of the technology, and the time pressure. Youker also looked at project size, duration, industrial sector, geographic location, number of workers, cost, complexity, urgency, and organizational design as attributes that help determine a project profile.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Complex Systems</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch02_s03_s01_p01">When is a project complex? The answer to this question depends on how you define complex. One way to explore this question is to look at complexity models in various disciplines for insights that may apply to project management. In biology, the simplest plant is composed of one cell. As the cellular structure increases in number of cells and the number of connections to other cells increases, the plant life is seen as more complex. In the animal kingdom, the single cell ameba is the simplest animal, and life becomes more complex as the numbers of cells combine to form muscles and organs.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch02_s03_s01_p02">The complexity of a system is usually determined by the number of parts or activities, the degree of differentiation between the parts, and the structure of their connections. Heterogeneous and irregularly configured systems are complex, such as organisms, airplanes, and junkyards. Order is the opposite of complex. Ordered systems are homogenous and redundant, like an interstate toll booth or a production line in a factory. Complex systems have multiple interacting components whose collective behavior cannot be simply inferred from the behavior of the components.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38087-fn02_005">Stephen Jay Gould, <em class="emphasis">Full House: The Spread of Excellence from Plato to Darwin</em> (New York: Three Rivers Press, 1996).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch02_s03_s01_p03">In addition to the number of parts, the degree of differentiation between parts and the number, type, and strength of relationships between parts also influences the degree of complexity. For example, the transistors in a computer have three connections to other parts of the computer, but each nerve cell in the human brain can be connected to thousands of other cells in the brain, which is why the human brain is more complex than a computer. Complexity is context dependent. A project is more or less complex in relation to the number of activities, the type and strength of relationships to other project activities, and the degree and type of relationships to the project environment.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch02_s03_s01_p04">Projects are complex <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">adaptive systems</a><span class="glossdef">Organization of elements that change in response to events in their environment.</span></span>. A complex adaptive system is a system consisting of a large number of parts or activities that interact with each other in numerous and various ways. A complex adaptive system is adaptive if the activities adjust or react to the events of the environment. Successful adaptive systems adjust in a way that facilitates or allows the system or project to achieve its purpose.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch02_s03_s01_p05">The dependence of the project on the activities, the interdependence of the activities, and the specialization of the activities underscore the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">relationship dependence</a><span class="glossdef">Activities that are affected by events that change the characteristics of other activities.</span></span> of project activities. This relationship dependence is a key aspect of complex adaptive systems. The nature of complex adaptive systems can be probed by investigating the impact of change in one activity and the effect on other activities and the behavior of the whole. Activities must be studied and understood as interrelated, connected parts of the whole. If you remove a computer chip from a computer and the computer powers down, do not assume the purpose of the chip was to provide power to the computer. If you remove or shorten a project kickoff activity, do not assume the project will finish earlier because of the dependence of later project activities on project kickoff activities. Any change to the kickoff activities will impact other activities and the project as a whole.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fwk-38087-ch02_s03_s01_p06">A chemical company was building a new plant in Tennessee with a new design model that was intended to shorten the design phase on the project and lower the cost. The design of the plant was managed by a United States–based company with part of the design work contracted to an Indian company. The engineers in the United States would work on the design and would electronically transfer the design work to India at the end of the day. Engineers in India, many who had graduated from U.S. colleges, continued to work on the design and at the end of the day would electronically transfer the work back to the United States. The project would benefit from differences in time zones that would allow work on the project twenty-four hours per day. The project would also benefit from the lower engineering wages in India. The project approach was abandoned when the project started falling behind schedule. The added complexity of the project offset the scheduling and cost benefit. The project complexity profile became significantly less complex when the execution approach changed from global to domestic partnering. The execution model could have worked but would have required more investment during the start-up phase of the project.</p>

After the chart was complete, the project manager ripped the chart up in front of the entire project team to demonstrate his key message, which was that there are formal reporting relationships, but the real leadership and communication will change during the life of the project. In other words, the system will adapt to meet the needs of the project at each phase. During the design phase, the engineering team will identify the primary needs and communication will center on supporting the engineering efforts. Later, the procurement team will take the lead as critical equipment and supplies are identified and purchased. Later in the project, the construction team takes the lead as the project moves from the design offices to the field and the engineering and procurement teams support the construction effort.</p>

The outcome can be reliably predicted if you know the starting conditions. For example, if you fire a rifle several times at a target, the hits on the target will be closely grouped if all the initial conditions are almost identical. A nonlinear, or chaotic, system can produce wildly different results even if the starting conditions are almost exactly the same. If today’s weather pattern is almost exactly the same as it was on a previous date, the weather a week later could be entirely different. Projects are usually nonlinear systems. If we execute an identical complex project three different times, we would deliver three different outcomes. We start with the assumption that the project is deterministic and use scenarios and simulations to develop the most likely outcome, yet a small change such as the timing of someone’s vacation or a small change in the delivery date of equipment can change the entire trajectory of a project.</p>

The drug was in the final FDA testing stage, and the company decided to accept the risk and proceed with designing and building a facility to manufacture the drug. The company had done this type of project before, and some managers felt that the outcome would be fairly predictable. The company assigned the lead scientist as the project manager to get the project started. Two weeks into the project start-up, the company president realized the project needed a project manager with more engineering and construction expertise and hired a new person to manage the project. Then the company decided to build the facility on land the company owned in Colorado, and the project team began designing a facility that would fit the existing site. Thirty days into the design phase, the company found an existing facility that could be retrofitted to meet the production needs of the new drug. During the first week of construction, the drug failed an FDA test and the project was placed on hold. This project environment was highly volatile, and the project plan and organization adjusted and evolved to respond to each of these changes.</p>

This is one of the reasons project managers develop an aggressive <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">change management process</a><span class="glossdef">Method of incorporating change into project planning and execution processes.</span></span>. The purpose of the change management process is not to stop change but to incorporate the change into the project planning and execution processes. Projects, like all other complex adaptive systems, must respond to the evolving environment to succeed. Plan as if the project is deterministic but be prepared for unpredictable changes.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch02_s03_s01_s02_p04">In addition to responding to changes in the project environment, the internal project organization and environment is in a constant state of change. New people become members of the team, people quit, retire, and get sick. The office roof starts leaking, headquarters rolls out a new computer program required for all workers, or the project’s lead engineer cannot get her immigration visa extended. These are real examples of events that occurred on one project, and the project team adjusted to each event. The adaptation to changes in the project’s internal situation while also adapting to the external environment reflects the coevolving nature of a complex adaptive system. An increase in the number of events within the project and the project environment that are likely to change during the life of the project is reflected in an increase in the complexity of a project.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch02_s03_s02_p02">Projects are more likely to fail in the beginning, not in the end. This generalized statement reflects the importance of understanding the environment in which a project will be executed and the importance of developing an execution plan that can be successfully implemented within this environment. Recovery costs can be extremely high for projects where the environment is misread or the execution plan does not address critical issues of the project environment. In addition to cost overruns and delays in the project, execution plans that are not aligned with the project environment can create barriers that make recovery difficult, and in some cases, the business purpose of the project cannot be met. The DPCI is a tool to assist project stakeholders in developing a comprehensive analysis of the project environment and a project execution plan more aligned with that environment. Understanding and aligning a project with the project’s environment increase the likelihood of achieving project success.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch02_s03_s02_p03">The foundation of a sound project execution plan is an assessment of the project environment. This assessment provides the information on which the execution plan is built. In the absence of an accurate assessment of the project environment, the project leadership makes assumptions and develops the execution plan around those assumptions. The quantity and quality of those assumptions will significantly influence the effectiveness of the project execution plan. The amount of information available to the project manager will increase over time and assumptions will be replaced with better information and better estimates. As better tools are developed for evaluating the project environment, better information will become available to the project manager.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch02_s03_s02_p04">The project environment includes all the conditions that can influence the outcome or success of the project. Project size, technological complexity, cultural and language barriers, the political landscape, and resource constraints are some of the components of the project environment that can influence the project success. Understanding these influences and developing a project profile creates a foundation for building an effective project execution plan.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch02_s03_s02_p05">The DPCI is one model for understanding and profiling projects. This index assesses the complexity level of key components of a project and produces a unique project profile. The profile indicates the project complexity level, which provides a benchmark for comparing projects and provides information about the characteristics of a project that can then be addressed in the project execution plan.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch02_s03_s02_p06">The DPCI provides project stakeholders with information about the project to define the experience, knowledge, skills, and abilities needed by the project manager. The DPCI also has implications for the composition, organization, and skills needed by the project leadership team. The DPCI provides information and a context for developing the project execution plan and for assessing the probability of success.</p>

The DPCI is built on four categories of attributes:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch02_s04_l02">
        <li>

    </ol>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-38087-ch02_s04_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">External Attributes</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch02_s04_s01_p01">The external attributes include those issues that are typically established early in the project definition phase and are usually outside the direct control of the project management team. The project size can be a product of the dollars needed to execute the project or project cost. The cost of the project is estimated during the conceptual phase of the project. At the time the project is authorized, the cost or size of the project is established. The duration or time allocated to complete the project and the resources available are also attributes that are established when the project is authorized.</p>
        <div class="section" id="fwk-38087-ch02_s04_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Size</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch02_s04_s01_s01_p01">Project size is a relative concept. How do we decide if something is large or small? A 150-pound person is big if the person is ten years old. A 150-pound person is small if the person is a professional football lineman. The frame of reference provides the context in which size is determined.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch02_s04_s01_s01_p02">The size of a project is also relative. A $250 million oil refinery expansion is a relatively small project in an industry where billion dollar projects are common. A $250 million pharmaceutical development project or software development project would be considered a large project. The size of a project is determined by the context of the industry and the experience of the team executing the project.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch02_s04_s01_s01_p03">Within the construction industry, firms usually specialize in projects that fall within a defined range. Small firms usually execute small projects and large firms usually execute larger projects. There is a size range for which the company experience, management skills, tools, and work processes are primarily designed. This size range or comfort zone exists for both the company and the members of the project team executing the project.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch02_s04_s01_s01_p04">When a project team executes a project outside their comfort zone, stress is placed on both the tools and project team. When a project is larger than the comfort zone of a company, stresses are placed on the ability to provide experience and appropriate work processes, and the results are typically cost overruns and schedule delays. To mitigate this stress, some companies will divide large projects into smaller projects and execute the smaller projects with separate dedicated staff and resources. The key to success then becomes the coordination of the small projects to behave as if they are one large project.</p>

                <h3 class="title">Copper Mining in Argentina</h3>
                <p class="para" id="fwk-38087-ch02_s04_s01_s01_p05">One example of this process was a copper mining project in Argentina. The comfort zone of the company was projects ranging from $150 million to $500 million. Projects over $500 million were divided into smaller projects. The mining project was estimated to cost a little over $1 billion and the project was divided into three projects, each with a project manager and leadership team. Although the projects shared some resources and reported to an oversight project manager, each project developed a separate execution plan that included a budget and schedule.</p>
            </div>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch02_s04_s01_s01_p06">When a company is executing a project that is much smaller than the company norm, resources are often misused and inappropriate work processes are utilized. The result often increases the project costs. Some companies with a history of executing large projects have set up a small project group to execute smaller projects. These groups establish a different culture, develop appropriate work processes, and use tools designed to execute smaller projects.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch02_s04_s01_s01_p07">The more the project size is outside the comfort zone of the project, the more stress is created for the project. This is true on both ends of the spectrum. Both smaller and larger projects that fall outside the comfort zone of the project management team will create stress for the project. New skills, tools, and processes will need to be developed to manage the project, and this activity will absorb management time and energy. The higher the stress level created by executing a project outside the comfort zone of the organization, the greater the impact on the complexity level of the project.</p>

        <div class="section" id="fwk-38087-ch02_s04_s01_s02">

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch02_s04_s01_s02_p01">The duration of a project is often set by the parent organization that charters the project with a deadline that reflects the business purpose of the project. The following are examples of projects with end dates that are established to meet the organization’s business purpose:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch02_s04_s01_s02_l01">
                <li>A new software program for a university to be implemented in time for registering students in the fall</li>
                <li>A new product to be introduced to the marketplace at the industry’s major conference</li>
                <li>A new high school to be constructed and open next fall</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch02_s04_s01_s02_p02">The project team also estimates the duration of the project and establishes a project end date based on normal work (e.g., forty hours per week) and the availability of resources.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch02_s04_s01_s02_p03">Sometimes the normal time needed to complete a project is longer than the time available.</p>

                <h3 class="title">Super Bowl Hotel Space</h3>
                <p class="para" id="fwk-38087-ch02_s04_s01_s02_p04">The investors in a planned hotel start booking rooms for an upcoming Super Bowl weekend a year before the hotel is finished. This is six weeks ahead of the time estimated to build and open the hotel. People will be working overtime, suppliers will be paid a bonus to supply materials early, and management is meeting with city officials to expedite permitting issues. A new project schedule is developed based on these changes to the execution approach, and now the project schedule has zero float.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch02_s04_s01_s02_p05">The result of this six-week compression to the project schedule is additional stress on the project. Significant management time and energy will be invested in tracking and managing schedule issues. Every issue that arises will need to be resolved quickly and involve the project’s senior manager to assure the project schedule does not slip. This additional stress increases the overall project complexity.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch02_s04_s01_s03_p01">Projects require both human and tangible resources. The project requires people with the right experience, knowledge, and skills to accomplish the assigned tasks. Construction projects typically require resources such as bricks and cranes. Some projects require specialized subcontractors with skills not found within the project team. Each of these resources required by the project will be needed at the point in the project schedule when the materials or skills are required. When these resources are scarce or not available, additional management time and energy is needed.</p>

The airframe for the new airplane was a new composite material. During the same period that Boeing was beginning construction of the new manufacturing facility, other new planes were announced, and the Air Force increased its demand for people with airplane manufacturing and maintenance experience. A project was chartered to train the people the new plant would need to manufacture the Boeing Dreamliner. The project manager found that the people with the skills and knowledge needed to develop the curriculum and train the workers were in short supply. In addition to the lack of skilled trainers, the materials needed for the workers to train on were also scarce. The project manager dedicated significant time and energy developing the resources the project needed.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch02_s04_s01_s03_p03">When resources needed to execute the project are not readily available, the project leadership dedicates more management time and energy to acquiring the resources or finding innovative solutions to accomplish the project goals without the needed resources or with creative alternative solutions. The more time and energy the management team must dedicate to searching for resources or alternatives, the more stress on the project. The more scarce and more important the resources, the more stress that is placed on the project.</p>

Internal attributes include clarity of objectives, clarity of scope, the organizational complexity, and stakeholder agreement. Although the clarity of objectives, as with the other attributes, can be improved during the life of the project, the project profile reflects the project at a given time. If the project objectives are not clear during the evaluation of the project, this lack of clarity impacts the complexity of the project.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch02_s04_s02_s02_p01">The project scope defines what is inside the project and what is outside. Does the project to train five hundred technicians for the Boeing 787 include recruiting and assessing potential employees? The project scope did include recruitment and assessment, but hiring processes and drug testing belonged to Boeing. This scope was clear about which responsibilities belonged to the contractor doing the training and which responsibilities belonged to the parent organization.</p>

An increase in the number of stakeholders adds stress to the project and influences the project’s complexity level. The business or emotional investment of the stakeholder in the project and the ability of the stakeholder to influence the project outcomes or execution approach will also influence the stakeholder complexity of the project.

                <p class="para" id="fwk-38087-ch02_s04_s02_s04_p04">A small college in South Carolina won a competitive grant to erect and operate a wind turbine on campus. The engineering department submitted the grant as a demonstration project for engineering students to expose students to wind technology. The campus facilities department found only one location for the wind turbine that would not disrupt the flow of traffic on campus. The engineering department found that location unacceptable for students who had to maintain the wind turbine. The county construction permitting department had no policies for permitting a wind turbine and would not provide a building permit. The college had to go to the county council and get an exception to county rules. The marketing department wanted the wind turbine placed in a highly visible location to promote the innovativeness of the college.</p>

The number of stakeholders on the project, multiplied by their passion for the subject and the lack of agreement on the location, increased the complexity of the project. Significant time and resources of the project will be dedicated to identifying, understanding, and managing client expectations.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch02_s04_s03_p01">The technology of a project refers to the product of the project and not the technology used to manage the project. This technology is typically unique to the industry. A pharmaceutical project technology is the drug-making technology or pharmacology. The technology for a project to build a new automobile plant is the car production process. The key stress on the project is the newness of the technology. What aspects of the technology are known, and what aspects are unknown? Does the project combine technologies on the project that have never been combined?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch02_s04_s03_p02">Project technology that is newer and more complex will require more technological expertise on the project team.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fwk-38087-ch02_s04_s03_p03">A church in western New York decided to build a new family life center that would not use electricity from the power grid. The charter of the project included statements that required the building to use renewable power sources and have an environmentally friendly footprint. The project required the adaptation of a new technology for producing and managing power, location of the building relative to the sun, and landscaping to minimize water usage. Most of the technology was tested, and the project team brought in experts to help design and implement a program to meet the requirements of the project. The technology of the project required the project team to develop a new understanding of this technology and work processes to adapt the project to address the requirement of the technology.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch02_s04_s03_p04">Typically, the newer the technology and the less familiar the project team is with the technology, the greater the stress and the contribution to the complexity of the project.</p>

A project to build an airport expansion in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania will have very different legal, cultural, political, and ecological issues to address from an airport expansion in São Paolo, Brazil. The environment attributes in Brazil require more planning, resources, and leadership attention to successfully execute the project. The greater the number and difficulty of the issues, the greater the influence on the complexity of the project.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch02_s04_s04_s01_p02">Workforce laws vary significantly in country, regional, and local jurisdictions. The hiring and management of workers can be a complex and time-consuming issue for some projects. Companies not used to working in a union environment will invest project resources in learning and adapting to the new environment. Scheduling holidays, supporting maternity leave, and dealing with workforce reduction issues surrounding project closeout will vary in each environment, industry, and project. Understanding and managing workforce issues on a project can be simple or very complex.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch02_s04_s04_s01_p03">National, regional, and local taxes require a project tax approach or policy on most international projects and some domestic projects. Duties for equipment and material brought into a country add complexity to the procurement plan. Equipment used temporarily to execute the project, such as a crane, is treated differently than permanently installed equipment, such as a pump. In some countries, a third party is hired to expedite the flow of materials through complex custom processes.</p>

The project leadership team included members from the United States, Canada, Australia, Argentina, Chile, Puerto Rico, Cuba, and Lebanon. Materials were procured, transported, and brought through customs from twenty-one different countries. Legal issues on this project consumed a great deal of management attention and sometimes affected the project execution. Materials were occasionally delayed in customs, people with critical skills could not get visas to enter Argentina, and which country’s laws would apply to the contracts had to be debated.</p>

The U.S. team believed strongly in their leadership capability and refused to make changes. This conflict was settled by senior managers of both organizations, and rules were established that respected all team members in leadership roles. The conflict did not go away, but the team was able to successfully execute the project with the original team. Delays were experienced on the project that could be traced to this cultural conflict.</p>

Institutions of higher learning, organizations related to judicial organizations, and most government organizations are examples of rule-based organizations. The organizational structure and culture inhibits risk taking through established rules and policies. Projects are goal based and focus on plans and processes to achieve goals. Goal-based cultures promote assuming risk to achieve goals. Projects that are closely tied to a rule-based parent organization will often find conflict with the parent organization’s need to follow rules and the project’s need to accomplish goals. This conflict creates additional stress that adds to the project complexity.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch02_s04_s04_s02_p05">On global projects, language, cultural conflict with the role of women, the religious role in daily activities, and even the concept of time can becomes issues on the project. These issues require project leadership to resolve and they add to the project complexity. In some countries and even different companies in the same country, meetings start on time, and a person arriving five minutes late will cause major disruption. In other situations, meetings can start within thirty minutes of the starting time without anyone objecting.</p>

In addition to the potential impact to land, water, and air, the ecology includes the sights and sounds that can impact the quality of life. An increasing number of clients expect the project team to minimize the impact of the project on the ecology. An ecology that is more sensitive to disruption and a more disruptive technology will place greater stress on the project and increase the project complexity. Construction projects that require the use of explosions to effectively move rocks and dirt, projects that require the addition of twenty-five people in existing office space, and projects that require the release of strong odors like those from adhesives in an office environment will all impact the ecology. The project team develops means and methods to minimize the impact of the disruption in a manner consistent with the requirements as communicated by the client. The effort that is needed to minimize the ecological impact will influence the complexity of the project.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch02_s07_s01_p01">Russell Darnall (Darnall 1996) introduced a method that rates characteristics of a project on a scale from 1 to 5. The characteristics are grouped into four categories: external attributes, internal attributes, technology, and project environment. Each category is rated based on the average of the scores of its attributes.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch02_s07_s01_p02">A method of calculating and representing the final Darnall-Preston Complexity Index (DPCI) was added by John Preston and Darnall in this publication to allow the DPCI to be represented by a four-number code. The rules for calculating the DPCI are as follows:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch02_s07_s01_l01">
            <li>The scores in each category are averaged and then rounded to a whole number to create a category rating.</li>
            <li>Averages that are halfway between two whole numbers are rounded up.</li>
            <li>If one of the characteristics has a score that is higher than the average for that category by 2 or more, the average for that category is shown in boldface.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch02_s07_s01_p03">A project can be quickly characterized using the DPCI. For example, a project that is similar in size to previous projects with plenty of time to complete it and with adequate resources available would have a low average external complexity score of 2 (see <a class="xref" href="#fwk-38087-ch02_s07_s01_t01">Table 2.1 "Calculating the DPCI"</a>). If there is significant disagreement among the stakeholders on the objectives and several scope issues are not well defined because there is overlap between responsibilities of groups within the organization, the internal complexity score would be high—4 (see <a class="xref" href="#fwk-38087-ch02_s07_s01_t01">Table 2.1 "Calculating the DPCI"</a>). If the project relies on technology that is fairly new and some of the team members are unfamiliar with it, the average score would be 2.5, rounded up to 3 (see <a class="xref" href="#fwk-38087-ch02_s07_s01_t01">Table 2.1 "Calculating the DPCI"</a>). If the legal and cultural attributes have low complexity, and there is little impact on the project by ecological factors, the average is low—2—in spite of a high complexity score for the effect of politics of the project. In this case, the score is shown in boldface to warn the user that there is an individual score that is at least two points higher than the average, and the details of that category must be investigated.</p>

(Refer to <a class="xref" href="fwk-38087-ch01_s07#fwk-38087-ch01_s07">Section 1.7 "Web Exercise"</a> and <a class="xref" href="fwk-38087-ch01_s08#fwk-38087-ch01_s08">Section 1.8 "Software and Technology Exercises"</a>, if necessary, for instruction on how to capture a screen.)</li>
                <li>Open a new word processing document and then paste the screen capture into the new document. Your name must be included in the screen capture. Save the document as <em class="emphasis">Ch02DPCIStudentName</em> using the Word 2003 .doc file format.</li>
                <li>
                    <p class="para">Move the mouse pointer to the boundary between the headers of columns A and B, where it turns into a double-headed pointer. Double-click the boundary to automatically adjust the column width to the widest label, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-38087-ch02_s07_s01_s01_f02">Figure 2.10 "Adjust Column Width"</a>. Alternatively, drag the boundary to the right to adjust the column width manually.</p>

                </li>
                <li>Repeat the skill you practiced in the previous step to widen column B to accommodate the longest label (or your name) in column B.</li>
                <li>Click cell D3. Type <em class="emphasis">=AVERAGE(C1:C3)</em> and then press Enter. The average of numbers in cells C1, C2, and C3 is calculated and displayed in cell D3. A sequence of cells is denoted by the first cell address and the last cell address separated by a colon.</li>
                <li>Click cell D7. Type <em class="emphasis">=AVERAGE(C4:C7)</em> and then press Enter.</li>
                <li>Use the skill you practiced in the previous steps to calculate the averages of the technological and environmental categories and display them in cells D9 and D13 respectively.</li>
                <li>
                    <p class="para">Click cell D13. Notice the formula displays in the formula bar, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-38087-ch02_s07_s01_s01_f03">Figure 2.11 "Adjusted Column Widths and Average Functions"</a> (You may ignore the alert boxes or notations due to the unused cells in column D.)</p>

                </li>
                <li>Capture this screen and then paste it into the word processing document <em class="emphasis">Ch02DPCIStudentName</em> below the previously captured screen.</li>
                <li>In the spreadsheet, click cell E3. Type <em class="emphasis">=ROUND(D3,0)</em> and then press Enter. The ROUND function requires two types of information. The first is a cell address and the second is the decimal place to which the number in that cell will be rounded. A zero indicates rounding to whole numbers. (See the spreadsheet Help menu if you would like more information about the ROUND function.)</li>
                <li>
                    <p class="para">Use the skill you practiced in the previous step to calculate the rounded values for each category. Click cell E13 to display the ROUND function in the formula bar, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-38087-ch02_s07_s01_s01_f04">Figure 2.12 "Round Function Rounds to the Nearest Whole Number"</a>. Notice the ROUND function in cell E9 rounded the number 2.5 up to 3. This is the method used for rounding in the DPCI.</p>

                </li>
                <li>Capture this screen and paste it into <em class="emphasis">Ch02DPCIStudentName.doc</em>.</li>
                <li>In cell B16, type <em class="emphasis">DPCI rating:</em>. In cell C16, type the DPCI rating <em class="emphasis">1.3.3.2</em> and then press Enter.</li>
                <li>Visually examine the individual scores in column C and the rounded averages in column E. Determine if any of the individual scores is 2 points or more higher than the rounded average. Notice that the political rating is 4, and the environmental rating is 2. Also notice that the clarity of objectives rating is 1 and the internal rating is 3. According to the DPCI method, the environmental rating should be displayed in bold. (Even though the internal rating has a score that is 2 points lower than the rounded average, it is not bold. An individual rating must be 2 points or more <em class="emphasis">higher</em> than the rounded average—not lower.)</li>
                <li>
                    <p class="para">Click cell C16. On the formula bar, select the <em class="emphasis">2</em> and then on the ribbon (or formatting toolbar) click the Bold button. The rating for environmental complexity is emphasized with bold font to indicate there is a significantly higher individual rating that should be considered, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-38087-ch02_s07_s01_s01_f05">Figure 2.13 "Ratings That Contain Higher Individual Ratings Are Bold"</a>.</p>
