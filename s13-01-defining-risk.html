There are no risk-free projects because there is an infinite number of events that can have a negative effect on the project.

Shenhar, and Dov Dvir, “Risk Management, Project Success, and Technological Uncertainty,” <em class="emphasis">R&amp;D Management</em> 32 (2002): 101–12.</span> studied the risk management practices on one hundred projects in a variety of industries. The results of this study suggested the following about risk management practices:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch11_s01_l02">
        <li>Risk management is not widely used.</li>
        <li>The projects that were most likely to have a risk management plan were those that were perceived to be high risk.</li>
        <li>When risk management practices were applied to projects, they appeared to be positively related to the success of the project.</li>
        <li>The risk management approach influenced the meeting of project schedules and cost goals but exerted less influence on project product quality.</li>
        <li>Good risk management increases the likelihood of a successful project.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch11_s01_p03">Risk deals with the uncertainty of events that could affect the project. Some potential negative project events have a high likelihood of occurring on specific projects. Examples are as follows:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch11_s01_l03">
        <li>Safety risks are common on construction projects.</li>
        <li>Changes in the value of local currency during a project affect purchasing power and budgets on projects with large international components.</li>
        <li>Projects that depend on good weather, such as road construction or coastal projects, face risk of delays due to exceptionally wet or windy weather.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch11_s01_p04">These are examples of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">known risks</a><span class="glossdef">Risks that can be anticipated, such as exceptionally bad weather.</span></span>. Known risks are events that have been identified and analyzed for which advanced planning is possible. Other risks are unknown or unforeseen.</p>

Members of the leadership team could not make the meeting or return to their home base, and progress on the project, like many projects that day, was delayed.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch11_s01_p10">A project was chartered to design and construct a copper mine at a cost not to exceed $1.2 billion. If a project is completed on time, within budget, and meets all quality specifications, the project is successful. If the price of copper drops below the profit threshold for the company, the organizational goals of the project may not be achieved. The price of copper is an organizational or business risk. The copper mining company authorized the project based on assumptions about the future price of copper. The price of copper is not a project risk on this project.</p>
