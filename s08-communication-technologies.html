    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch06_p01">Projects require teamwork, and team members must communicate with each other in a variety of ways. The documents they produce must be collected, distributed, and stored in an appropriate manner to assure timely and accurate communication between team members. This process is often assisted by a variety of technologies and computer software products. Communication technology can facilitate faster and better communication, or it can become a barrier if the technologies are not well understood and applied appropriately.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch06_s01_p01">Completing a complex project successfully requires good communication among team members. If those team members work in the same building, they can arrange regular meetings, simply stop by each other’s office space to get a quick answer, or even discuss a project informally at other office functions. Many projects are performed by teams that interact primarily through electronic communication and are, therefore, called virtual teams.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38087-fn06_001"><em class="emphasis">Business Dictionary</em>, s.v. “Virtual Team,” <a class="link" href="http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/virtual-team.html">http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/virtual-team.html</a> (accessed January 27, 2010).</span> To avoid miscommunication that can harm trust and to include team members in a project culture, the project team needs a plan for communicating reliably and in a timely manner. This planning begins with understanding two major categories of communication.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Synchronous Communications</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch06_s01_s01_p01">If all the parties to the communication are taking part in the exchange at the same time, the communication is synchronous. A telephone conference call is an example of synchronous communication. When the participants are not interacting at the same time, the communication is not synchronous, or <strong class="emphasis bold">a</strong>synchronous.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch06_s01_s01_p02">The following are examples of synchronous communications:</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch06_s01_s01_s01_p01">The worldwide communication network makes it possible to assemble project teams from anywhere in the world. Most people work during daylight hours, which can make synchronous meetings difficult if the participants are in different time zones, where they start, end, and take meal breaks at different times. It can be an advantage in some circumstances. For example, if something must be done by the start of business tomorrow, team members in Asia can work on the problem during their normal work hours while team members in North America get some sleep.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch06_s01_s01_s01_p02">As the earth turns, the sun appears to move across the sky from east to west. Local noon occurs when the sun is at its highest position in the sky. Cities and countries to the north or south of each other all observe local noon at the same time. For example, noon in New York occurs at the same time as it does in Bogotá, Colombia, in South America. Be aware that many well-educated people in the United States think of South America as directly south of North America. As you can see in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-38087-ch06_s01_s01_s01_f01">Figure 6.4 "World Time Zones"</a>, most of South America is one or two time zones east of the United States.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch06_s01_s01_s01_p03">To prevent confusion between a.m. and p.m., times are given using a twenty-four-hour clock. Noon is 12:00 and 1 p.m. is 13:00, and parts of an hour are divided by colons. For example, 13:25:21 is thirteen hours, twenty-five minutes, and twenty-one seconds.</p>

                <p class="para" id="fwk-38087-ch06_s01_s01_s02_p02">A project manager in New York is five time zones west of the reference zone, so the time is given as UT –5 (or GMT –5). If it is noon in the reference zone, it is 7 a.m. (five hours earlier) in New York. The manager would like to contact a project team member in Paris, France. Paris is one time zone west of the reference zone (UT +1 or GMT +1). If it is noon (12:00) in the reference zone, it is 13:00 (1 p.m.) in Paris.</p>
                <p class="para" id="fwk-38087-ch06_s01_s01_s02_p03">This means that there is a six-hour difference between New York and Paris.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch06_s01_s02_p01">Getting a team together at the same time can be a challenge—especially if they are spread out across time zones. Many types of communication do not require that the parties are present at the same time. This type of communication is not synchronous; it is asynchronous. There are several choices of asynchronous communications.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch06_s01_s02_s01_p01">Many companies prefer that final contracts are personally signed by an authorized representative of each party to the agreement. If several signatures are required, this can take weeks to get all the signatures if the contracts are transferred by the postal service. If this process is holding up the start of the project, you can use an overnight delivery service to minimize the time spent transferring the documents.</p>

A fax machine typically has a paper feeder that can be used for feeding multiple-page documents, a telephone key pad and handset, and a status display, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-38087-ch06_s01_s02_s02_f01">Figure 6.5 "Fax Machine"</a>.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch06_s01_s02_s02_p02">Transmission rates of fax machines are typically limited by the use of traditional telephone lines.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch06_s01_s02_s02_p03">The Group 3 fax machine digitizes data in a form that is compatible with computers and the fax function is often integrated with other computer functions.

                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch06_s02_s01_s01_s01_p01">Word processing software programs display a document on a computer’s screen and allow the user to enter and edit text. When the file is saved to a storage device, the text and all the various formatting such as font and font size are converted to a code for efficient storage. The code varies from one word processing program to another and even between releases of the same program.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch06_s02_s01_s01_s01_p02">The most common word processing program, by a wide margin, is Microsoft Word (MS Word). Several releases of MS Word run on the Windows operating system and on the Macintosh operating system. Versions of MS Word released prior to 2007 save files in a proprietary format. The format is indicated by a period and a three-letter extension—.doc—that is automatically attached to the file when it is saved. Beginning with MS Word 2007 for Windows and MS Word 2008 for Macintosh, files are saved using a different format that is indicated by a period and a four-letter extension—.docx—that identify the newer format.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch06_s02_s01_s01_s01_p03">Almost all word processing programs have the ability to save files in the .doc file format, and it is a common standard for word processing files. Newer versions of word processing programs, including MS Word 2007 and MS Word for Mac 2008, can save files in the older .doc format. There are new features in MS Word 2007—such as the ability to format citations in a variety of styles, including APA, MLA, and Chicago—that are lost when the file is saved in the .doc format. Older versions of MS Word can be adapted to read the newer .docx file formats by downloading and installing a compatibility program that is available at no cost from Microsoft’s Web site. Display of document file extensions is hidden by default in the Windows operating system. They can be displayed by turning off this feature. Instructions for displaying the file extensions are available from the operating system’s help menu. In the Windows Vista operating system, the option is found on the Control Panel, in Appearance and Personalization, in Folder Options, on the View tab, under Advanced Settings, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-38087-ch06_s02_s01_s01_s01_f01">Figure 6.8 "Displaying File Name Extensions"</a>.</p>

Most data management programs arrange data in such a way that each type of data is represented by a column with a label at the top and each row contains the specific data for one type of item.

For example, if the spreadsheet has a list of expenses, the rows of data can be sorted in decreasing or increasing value by one of the data types such as the due date or the amount of the expense. The display can be restricted—<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">filtered</a><span class="glossdef">Display is restricted to data that meets criteria.</span></span>—to display only those rows that meet criteria specified by the user. For example, the table could be filtered to display the expenses for a particular department that were incurred between two dates.

A sequence of dates can be created as column labels by entering the first two dates in the sequence, selecting both dates, and then dragging the fill handle—a small square in the lower right corner of the selected cell, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-38087-ch06_s02_s01_s02_s05_f01">Figure 6.20 "Creating a Sequence of Dates"</a>—to extend the pattern.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch06_s02_s01_s02_s05_p02">The program is sophisticated enough to correctly fill date sequences between months that have a different number of days and even account for leap years in February. Because more sophisticated project management software uses a table design in which the first two columns are description and duration, a similar structure, in which those two columns are adjacent and in that order will make it convenient to transfer the list of activities in a low-complexity project into the project management software at a later date if the spreadsheet is not sufficient. In the duration column, use the following abbreviations:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch06_s02_s01_s02_s05_l01">

                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch06_s02_s01_s02_s05_p03">The duration of each activity and the relationships between activities can be illustrated using the drawing shapes. In Excel 2007, the same set of shapes and connector arrows are available as those in Word 2007. A long rectangle can represent a bar whose length represents the duration of the activity. Events or significant dates in the project are identified with a diamond. The diamond can be created by using a small square shape and rotating it. Arrows can be drawn between the shapes to indicate their relationships, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-38087-ch06_s02_s01_s02_s05_f02">Figure 6.21 "Diagram of Activities"</a>. Unfortunately, the arrows in Excel 2007 connect to handles on the sides of the rotated squares instead of the corners. This detail may be overlooked in a simple project diagram.</p>

If more than one person is editing his or her own copy of a document at the same time, different versions of the document with different additions or corrections are created.

One of the ways that a user can still lose a lot of work is by replacing a newer version of a document with an older version. It is possible to display the date on which the file was last saved using the Details view. If more than one version of the file exists in two different locations, the dates can be compared to determine which is the most recent. These techniques are useful for simple projects with very few participants.</p>

The market for diagramming software is more diverse than for word processing and spreadsheets, and it is not as likely that most team members will have the same programs that save files in the same formats. Microsoft Viseo 2007 is available as a stand-alone program that sells for several hundred dollars. For medium-complexity projects, a free alternative to Viseo is Open Office Draw. Open Office is a free software alternative that includes a word processing, spreadsheet, presentation, and drawing programs. The Open Office Draw program, and others like it, can create diagrams such as the one shown in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-38087-ch06_s02_s01_s04_f01">Figure 6.24 "Diagram Created Using Open Office Draw"</a>.</p>

Dedicated project management software can compute the sum of activity durations along several different paths through complex relationships and recalculate them immediately if any of the durations or starting times are changed. Similarly, charts and reports are updated automatically based on the new data. The most popular software for medium-complexity projects is Microsoft Project. If a project manager begins work on the project in the belief that it can be managed using a list of activities in a word processing program or in a spreadsheet, the list of activities and their durations can be copied and pasted, or imported, into the project management software’s table of activities, if the original document or spreadsheet was designed with that possibility in mind, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-38087-ch06_s02_s01_s05_f01">Figure 6.25 "List of Activities Transferred to a Project Management Program"</a>.</p>

Large, complex projects are common in the construction industry. A software that is commonly used for complex projects in construction is P3 or P6 from Primavera. It has the ability to produce sophisticated reports that help project managers to anticipate problems and make projections.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch06_s02_s01_s06_p02">Word processing documents often contain data that could be aggregated and analyzed. Beginning with Microsoft Word 2007 and the .docx file format, it is possible to insert characters called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">tags</a><span class="glossdef">Labels that enclose text to describe how it is displayed or to give it meaning as data.</span></span> on either side of a particular section of a form or document and assign a data label. For example, the name of the supplier on an invoice could be enclosed between two tags: &lt;supplier&gt;Thompson Hardware&lt;/supplier&gt;. These tags resemble those used in the hypertext markup language (HTML) to identify how to display text on a Web page, but instead of telling a Web browser how to display the name of the supplier, it identifies Thompson Hardware as the supplier. These tags are can be created by following a set of rules called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">extensible markup language (XML)</a><span class="glossdef">Rules for defining tags that can identify text as data or for display purposes.</span></span>. Forms created using XML can be scanned for the content that is marked by tags. The data can be imported into a spreadsheet or database for analysis. Creating documents that use XML to identify data in the forms can be done using Microsoft InfoPath. An example that identifies key facts in a document that was prepared using InfoPath is shown in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-38087-ch06_s02_s01_s06_f01">Figure 6.27 "InfoPath Form with XML Tags"</a>. Because it takes extra effort to learn to use InfoPath, or a similar XML authoring program, and to create the forms, this approach is normally limited to complex and sophisticated organizations that have the need to manage large amounts of data.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch06_s05_s01_s02_p02">Wired telephones are connected physically to a local switch that can handle up to ten thousand connections represented by the last four-digit numbers in a telephone number from 0000 to 9999. Each switch is identified by a three-digit number such as 555. A local telephone number consists of the switch number and one of the ten thousand four-digit numbers such as 555 0112. This system can provide up to ten million different unique phone numbers,<span class="footnote" id="preston_2.0-6.5.xml-fnpreston_2.0-6.5.xml_001">The three-digit area code plus the next four digits make up a seven-digit number. A seven-digit number has ten million possible combinations from 000 0000 to 999 9999. In practice, some area codes are reserved for special purposes such as trouble-shooting, emergencies, directory assistance, and maintenance, so the maximum is less than ten million per area code. For example, numbers 555-0100 through 555-0199 are reserved for fictional use and are not assigned to real customers.</span>
 but it does not have the capacity to provide service to billions of people.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch06_s05_s01_s02_p03">The switches are grouped into areas and assigned a group number or area code. Area codes in North America were assigned at a time when numbers were converted to a sequence of electrical pulses by inserting your finger in a rotary disc—the dial—and pulling it to a stop on a phone like the one shown in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-38087-ch06_s05_s01_s02_f01">Figure 6.29 "Rotary Dial Telephone"</a>.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch06_s05_s01_s02_p04">As a spring returns the dial to its original position, it opens and closes a set of electrical contacts to create a series of pulses that match the number dialed. Because it takes longer to dial higher numbers like 8 or 9, area codes that could be dialed quickly like 212 and 213 were assigned to densely populated areas like Manhattan (212) and Los Angeles (213). Higher numbers were assigned to rural areas or to newer areas. As a result, it is difficult to determine where a telephone is located by its area code. Do not assume that numbers with similar area codes in North America are located in the same time zone—they may be thousands of miles apart. To initiate a call to a different area code, the number 1 is dialed first. This is the national direct dialing (NDD) code for NANP members.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch06_s05_s01_s05_p01">It is commonly understood in the United States that you do not enter the hyphens, parentheses, spaces, or periods that are used to make a telephone number more readable and that you dial 1 first—even though it is not included—for a call destined for a different area code. For example, if the phone number on the business card shows (555) 222-1111, you know that you would enter 2221111 if you are calling from within the 555 area code<span class="footnote" id="preston_2.0-6.5.xml-fnpreston_2.0-6.5.xml_002">Some area codes cover large geographic areas, and the NDD code is required to dial a number from within the same area code if they are far apart.</span>
 or 15552221111 for a call from a different area code, but you would not attempt to enter the parentheses, space, or hyphen. Spaces are used in some instances in the following discussion to make the numbers easier to read in this text, but it will be understood that they are not entered when dialing the number.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch06_s05_s01_s06_p01">Unlike those countries participating in the NANP, other countries use different numbers for the national direct dialing (NDD) code and the country code. They might use a different number of digits for the area or city code. A business card from a team member in Rio de Janeiro might be +55 (0)21-xxxx xxxx where 55 is the country code and 0 is the NDD code. To call this team member from the United States on a wired telephone, you would enter 011 55 21 xxxx xxxx, where 011 is the IDD for the United States, 55 is the country code for Brazil, and 21 is the code for Rio de Janeiro.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch06_s05_s01_s06_p02">Notice the zero between 55 and 21 is not included when calling from outside the country. This is the NDD code that is used for calls between areas within the country. For example, if you land in the airport at Sao Paulo, Brazil, and want to call the person in Rio de Janeiro from a local phone, you would enter 0 21 xxxx xxxx (without the spaces) where 0 is the NDD code—like 1 in the United States—and 21 is the area/city code.</p>
