    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch09_s02_p01">Projects seldom go according to plan in every detail. It is necessary for the project manager to be able to identify when costs are varying from the budget and to manage those variations.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Managing Cash Flow</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch09_s02_s01_p01">If the total amount spent on a project is equal to or less than the amount budgeted, the project can still be in trouble if the funding for the project is not available when it is needed. There is a natural tension between the financial people in an organization, who do not want to pay for the use of money that is just sitting in a checking account, and the project manager, who wants to be sure that there is enough money available to pay for project expenses. The financial people prefer to keep the company’s money working in other investments until the last moment before transferring it to the project account. The contractors and vendors have similar concerns, and they want to get paid as soon as possible so they can put the money to work in their own organizations. The project manager would like to have as much cash available as possible to use if activities exceed budget expectations.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Contingency Reserves</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch09_s02_s01_s01_p01">Most projects have something unexpected occur that increases costs above the original estimates. If estimates are rarely exceeded, the estimating method should be reviewed because the estimates are too high. It is not possible to predict which activities cost more than expected, but it is reasonable to assume that some of them will be. Estimating the likelihood of such events is part of risk analysis, which is discussed in more detail in a later chapter.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch09_s02_s01_s01_p02">Instead of overestimating each cost, money is budgeted for dealing with unplanned but statistically predictable cost increases. Funds allocated for this purpose are called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">contingency reserves</a><span class="glossdef">Money held to pay for predictable but unspecified extra costs.</span></span>.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38087-fn09_001">Project Management Institute, Inc., <em class="emphasis">A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK Guide)</em>, 4th ed.

It could be an opportunity as well as a challenge. Money can be made available to the project to be used at the discretion of the manager to meet needs that would change the scope of the project. These funds are called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">management reserves</a><span class="glossdef">Money that is available for changing the scope of the project.</span></span>.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch09_s02_s02_p01">A project manager must regularly compare the amount of money spent with the budgeted amount and report this information to managers and stakeholders. It is necessary to establish an understanding of how this progress will be measured and reported.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Reporting Budget Progress on John’s Move</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-38087-ch09_s02_s02_p02">In the John’s move example, he estimated that the move would cost about $1,500 and take about sixteen days. Eight days into the project, John has spent $300. John tells his friends that the project is going well because he is halfway through the project but has only spent a fifth of his budget. John’s friend Carlita points out that his report is not sufficient because he did not compare the amount spent to the budgeted amount for the activities that should be done by the eighth day.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch09_s02_s02_p03">As John’s friend points out, a budget report must compare the amount spent with the amount that is expected to be spent by that point in the project. Basic measures such as percentage of activities completed, percentage of measurement units completed, and percentage of budget spent are adequate for less complex projects, but more sophisticated techniques are used for projects with higher complexity.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Earned Value Management</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch09_s02_s02_s01_p01">A method that is widely used for medium- and high-complexity projects is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">earned value management (EVM)</a><span class="glossdef">Method of comparing the budgeted and actual costs of a project during the project.</span></span> method. EVM is a method of comparing the budgeted and actual costs of a project periodically during the project. It combines the scheduled activities with detailed cost estimates of each activity. It allows for partial completion of an activity if some of the detailed costs associated with the activity have been paid but others have not. The earned value analysis method compares the anticipated cost of work that is scheduled to be done at a given point in time against what has been done and how much it actually cost.</p>

Consequently, the lunch cost less than expected. John makes a stop at a store that sells moving supplies at discount rates. They do not have all the items he needs, but the prices are lower than those quoted by the moving company. They have a very good price on lifting straps so he decides to buy an extra pair. He returns with some of the items on his list, but this phase of the job is not complete by the end of day six. John bought half of the small boxes, all of five other items, twice as many lifting straps, and none of four other items. John is only six days into his project, and his costs and performance are starting to vary from the plan. Earned value analysis gives us a method for reporting that progress.

                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch09_s02_s02_s04_s02_p01">If the manager decides that the cost variance is caused by factors that will affect the remaining activities, such as higher labor and material costs, then the estimate to complete (ETC) needs to be adjusted by dividing it by the cost performance index (CPI). For example, if labor costs on the first part of a project are estimated at $80,000 (EV) and they actually cost $85,000 (AC), the cost variance will be 0.94. (Recall that the cost variance = EV - AC).</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch09_s02_s02_s04_s02_p02">To calculate the estimate to complete (ETC) assuming the cost variance on known activities is typical of future cost, the formula is ETC = (BAC – EV)/CPI. If the budget at completion (BAC) of the project is $800,000, the estimate to complete is ($800,000 – $80,000)/0.94 = $766,000.</p>

                    <li>Extra money is allocated in a contingency fund to deal with activities where costs exceed estimates. Funds are allocated in a management reserves in case a significant opportunity or challenge occurs that requires change of scope but funds are needed immediately before a scope change can typically be negotiated.</li>
                    <li>Schedule variance is the difference between the part of the budget that has been done so far (EV) versus the part that was planned to be completed by now (PV). Similarly, the cost variance is the difference between the EV and the actual cost (AC).</li>
                    <li>The schedule performance index (SPI) is the ratio of the earned value and the planned value. The cost performance index (CPI) is the ratio of the earned value (EV) to the actual cost (AC).</li>
                    <li>The formula used to calculate the amount of money needed to complete the project (ETC) depends on whether or not the cost variance to this point is expected to continue (typical) or not (atypical). If the cost variance is atypical, the ETC is simply the original total budget (BAC) minus the earned value (EV). If they are typical of future cost variances, the ETC is adjusted by dividing the difference between BAC and EV by the CPI.</li>
                    <li>The final budget is the actual cost (AC) to this point plus the estimate to complete (ETC).</li>
