<em class="emphasis">Client satisfaction</em>. Should the project manager go beyond the written requirements in the project scope statement to satisfy the client? Does the answer to this question depend on the role of the project in the organization? For example, does it matter if the organization is a consulting firm that sells project management or if the project is done for another department in the same organization? Form an opinion on this topic, and write a few paragraphs on it to organize your thoughts on the subject. Be prepared to share your thoughts with classmates. Submit the work as directed by your instructor.</li>
            <li>
<em class="emphasis">Organizational priorities</em>. Consider that three different organizations are planning to construct a building for their own use. The organizations are a for-profit company, a religious group, and a local school district. Choose three project knowledge areas, and consider how the project might be affected in each of these areas by the different types of organizations behind the project.
