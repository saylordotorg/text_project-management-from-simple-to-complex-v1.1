The early start date for an activity is the earliest date the activity can begin. The estimate considers durations and resource availability calendars.

            <p class="para" id="fwk-38087-ch08_s03_s01_p02">John begins planning his move to Atlanta the same day he accepts the job. The start date in this example is Monday, November 29, 2010. Tasks 1.1 and 2.1 can both start on that day, so the early start dates for tasks 1.1 and 2.1 are November 29. John calculates the early start date for the activities. A partial list is provided below. Compare the figure below and the figure in the next sidebar. Observe that John is willing to work on weekends, but activity 2.2.3 is delayed by two days because one of the moving companies did not provide bids on the weekend. Observe that activity 2.3 has a lead time of one day, but that relationship is between activity 2.1 and 2.3. The network path from activity 1.3 is longer, so the lead time with activity 2.1 is not considered in calculating the early start date of 2.3.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch08_s03_s03_p01">The next step is to work through the network diagram from right to left beginning with the mandated completion date, which is a milestone that is set in the project plan. Subtract the duration of each activity in each path to determine the latest date the activity could begin and still meet the project completion date. Resource calendars must be considered in the backward pass as well as the forward pass.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch08_s03_s03_p02">To calculate late start dates, begin with the project completion milestone and assign that date as the finish date of its predecessor activities.

        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch08_s03_s03_l01">
            <li>Subtract the predecessor activity’s duration from its late finish date.</li>

            <li>Refer to the resource calendar (or calendars) that applies to the people and equipment necessary for the activity, and subtract the number of off days that the activity would span on those calendars.</li>
            <li>Assign the calculated date as the late start date of the predecessor activity.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch08_s03_s03_p03">The difference between the early start date and the late start date for activities on the critical path is usually the same as the total float, unless the activities are affected by the resource calendars differently in the forward and backward pass. For example, if a piece of key equipment is only available for a few days, activities that depend on it have the same start and finish dates in the forward and backward passes.</p>
