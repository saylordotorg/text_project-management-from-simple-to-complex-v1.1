    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_p01">Project managers have two different interests in quality. Some projects are performed to provide a significant improvement in the quality of an existing process, and the project activities themselves must reflect high-quality standards. A basic knowledge of the statistics and procedures used in quality control will help the project manager understand the objectives of step projects and perform projects in companies that are committed to high-quality standards.</p>

Gasoline must not be contaminated with dirt or water, and the actual performance of the fuel must be close to its octane rating. A shipment of low-grade gasoline graded as 87 octane that is free of water or other contaminants would be of high quality, while a shipment of high grade 93 octane gas that is contaminated with dirt would be of low quality.</p>

The pieces are important to John for sentimental reasons and they are also valuable. John decides to hire movers (high-grade professionals) to load his furniture into the truck using appropriate padding and restraints to prevent dents and scratches during the long trip to Atlanta and then to unload the truck in Atlanta. John’s standard for high quality is that no observable damage occurs to his large pieces of furniture, especially the antiques. If the furniture arrives in his new apartment without a single dent, scratch, or other damage, the activity will be of high quality.</p>

His dishes are old and cheap, so he decides to trust his inexperienced friends (low-grade amateurs) to help him pack his kitchen. If a few of the dishes or glassware are chipped or broken in the process, the savings in labor cost will more than make up for the loss, and the dishes can be easily replaced. If John has a few chipped dishes and a broken glass or two by the time he is unpacked in Atlanta, he will consider the kitchen packing to be of high quality.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s01_s02_p02">A petroleum refinery produces large quantities of fuel in several grades. Samples of the fuels are extracted and measured at regular intervals. If a fuel is supposed to have an 87 octane performance, samples of the fuel should produce test results that are close to that value. Many of the samples will have scores that are different from 87. The differences are due to random factors that are difficult or expensive to control. Most of the samples should be close to the 87 rating and none of them should be too far off. The manufacturer has grades of 85 and 89, so they decide that none of the samples of the 87 octane fuel should be less than 86 or higher than 88.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s01_s02_p03">If a process is designed to produce a product of a certain size or other measured characteristic, it is impossible to control all the small factors that can cause the product to differ slightly from the desired measurement. Some of these factors will produce products that have measurements that are larger than desired and some will have the opposite effect. If several random factors are affecting the process, they tend to offset each other most of the time, and the most common results are near the middle of the range. This idea is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">central limit theorem</a><span class="glossdef">Idea that if variation is caused by several random factors, they will generally cancel each other out and most measurements will be near the middle of the range of variation.</span></span>.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s01_s02_p05">A refinery’s quality control manager measures many samples of 87 octane gasoline, sorts the measurements by their octane rating into bins that are 0.1 octane wide, and then counts the number of measurements in each bin. Then she creates a frequency distribution chart of the data, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-38087-ch10_s01_s02_f01">Figure 10.1 "Normal Distribution of Measurements of Gasoline Samples"</a>.</p>

To calculate the standard deviation, first the difference between each value and the mean is squared. The squared values are summed and divided by the number of values minus one. The square root of this value is the standard deviation, also known as the Sample Standard Deviation.</span></span>. The first step in calculating the standard deviation is subtracting each measurement from the central value and then squaring that difference. (Recall from your mathematics courses that squaring a number is multiplying it by itself and that the result is always positive.) The next step is to sum these squared values and divide by the number of values minus one. The last step is to take the square root. The result can be thought of as an average difference. (If you had used the usual method of taking an average, the positive and negative numbers would have summed to zero.) Mathematicians represent the standard deviation with the lowercase Greek letter σ (pronounced sigma). If all the elements of a group are measured, it is called the standard deviation of the population and the second step does not use a minus one.</p>

            <p class="para">The chart shows that the most common measurements of octane rating are close to 87 and that the other measurements are distributed equally above and below 87. The shape of the distribution chart supports the central limit theorem’s assumption that the factors that are affecting the octane rating are random and tend to offset each other, which is indicated by the symmetric shape. This distribution is a classic example of a normal distribution. The quality control manager notices that none of the measurements are above 88 or below 86 so they are within control limits and concludes that the process is working satisfactorily.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s01_s02_p08">For normal distributions, about 68.3 percent of the measurements fall within one standard deviation on either side of the mean. This is a useful rule of thumb for analyzing some types of data. If the variation between measurements is caused by random factors that result in a normal distribution and someone tells you the mean and the standard deviation, you know that a little over two-thirds of the measurements are within a standard deviation on either side of the mean. Because of the shape of the curve, the number of measurements within two standard deviations is 95.4 percent, and the number of measurements within three standard deviations is 99.7 percent. For example, if someone said the average (mean) height for adult men in the United States is 5 feet 10 inches (70 inches) and the standard deviation is about 3 inches, you would know that 68 percent of the men in the United States are between five feet seven inches (67 inches) and six feet one inch (73 inches) in height. You would also know that about 95 percent of the adult men in the United States were between five feet four inches and six feet four inches tall, and that almost all of them (99.7 percent) are between five feet one inches and six feet seven inches tall.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s01_s02_p10">Some products must have less variability than others to meet their purpose. For example, if one machine drills a hole and another machine shapes a rod that will slide through the hole, it might be very important to be sure that if the smallest hole was ever matched with the widest rod, that the rod would still fit. Three standard deviations from the control limits might be fine for some products but not for others. In general, if the mean is six standard deviations from both control limits, the likelihood of a part exceeding the control limits from random variation is practically zero (2 in 1,000,000,000).

In 1790 in France, Honoré Blanc demonstrated that he could make musket parts so nearly identical that a musket could be assembled from bins of parts chosen at random.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38087-fn10_002">Ken Alder, “Innovation and Amnesia: Engineering Rationality and the Fate of Interchangeable Parts Manufacturing in France,” <em class="emphasis">Technology and Culture</em> 38, no 2 (April 1997): 273–311.</span> The practice of making parts to a high level of accuracy in their dimensions and finishes made the parts interchangeable. The use of interchangeable parts became the founding principle of assembly line manufacturing to produce all manner of goods from sewing machines to automobiles. The manufacturers of firearms and weapons were often the leaders in improving quality because reliable and safe operation of weapons and their rapid repair is a matter of life and death.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s02_s02_p01">During World War II, factories were converted from manufacturing consumer goods to weapons.

A key figure in the history of quality management who was an important person in the war effort was Walter Shewhart at Bell Telephone Laboratories. Shewhart recognized that real processes seldom behaved like theoretical random distributions and tended to change with time. He separated causes of variation into two categories: <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">chance cause</a><span class="glossdef">Variation due to random events.</span></span> and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">assignable cause</a><span class="glossdef">Variations that can be attributed to a particular event or influence.</span></span>. Chance causes could be ignored if they did not cause too much variation, and trying to eliminate them often made the problem worse, but assignable causes could be fixed. To help distinguish between variations caused by random events and trends that indicated assignable causes, Shewhart introduced the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">control chart</a><span class="glossdef">Scatter chart with time on the horizontal axis and measurement scale on the vertical axis.

A control chart has time on the bottom axis and a plot of sample measurements.

W. Edwards Deming worked with Shewhart at Bell Labs and helped apply Shewhart’s ideas to American manufacturing processes during World War II. Following the war, American factories returned to the production of consumer goods. Many of the other major manufacturing centers in the world had been damaged by bombing during the war and took time to recover. Without the safety needs of wartime and with little competition, quality control was not a high priority for American companies.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38087-fn10_003">John Dowd, “How the Japanese Learned to Compete,” <em class="emphasis">Asia Times</em>, October 27, 2006, <a class="link" href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Japan/HJ27Dh01.html">http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Japan/HJ27Dh01.html</a> (accessed August 11, 2009).</span> Management in the United States focused on increasing production to meet demand and lowering costs to increase profits.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s02_s03_p02">After the war, while the United States occupied Japan, Deming was asked by the U.S. Department of the Army to assist with the statistics of the 1950 census in Japan. Kenichi Koyanagi, the managing director of the Union of Japanese Scientists and Engineers and a very influential industrialist, asked Deming to speak to twenty-one top industrial leaders on the topic of global strategy for Japanese industry. Deming went beyond Shewhart’s work and talked about his philosophy of quality manufacturing and how the responsibility for quality begins with management. He explained that a corporate culture devoted to producing high-quality products would result in less waste, lower costs, greater client loyalty, and greater market share. With Koyanagi’s support, Deming’s ideas were widely adopted by these influential leaders.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s02_s03_p03">Deming described his philosophy as a system of profound knowledge, which has four parts:</p>

            <li>End the practice of awarding business on the basis of price tag. Instead, minimize cost. Move toward a single supplier for any one item, on a long-term relationship of loyalty and trust.</li>
            <li>Improve constantly and forever the system of production and service to improve quality and productivity and thus constantly decrease costs.</li>
            <li>Institute training on the job.</li>
            <li>Institute leadership. The aim of supervision should be to help people and machines and gadgets to do a better job. Supervision of management is in need of overhaul, as well as supervision of production workers.</li>

Petersen, “Total Quality Management and the Deming Approach to Quality Management,” <em class="emphasis">Journal of Management History</em> 5, no. 8 (1999): 468–88.</span> TQM differs from the Deming approach in four fundamental ways:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s02_s04_l03">
            <li>The Deming approach represents one philosophy that is used in its entirety or not at all. In contrast, TQM can be tailored to a particular environment.</li>
            <li>Both agree that a long-term commitment is required by top management. However, Deming would drop clients if they started to wane, while TQM consultants were less demanding.</li>
            <li>Deming insists on constancy of purpose, while TQM adapts to the situation, which results in lack of constancy.</li>
            <li>Deming requires adoption of his principles of profound knowledge, while TQM lacks this unified philosophy.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s02_s04_p06">Many poorly qualified consulting firms provided training in TQM to American companies. The approach worked in some cases but not in others where it was applied superficially, and the movement’s credibility was diminished.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s02_s04_p07">Another approach to quality management in the United States was formulated at Motorola in 1986 and was named <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Six Sigma (6σ)</a><span class="glossdef">Quality management system that give titles to specialists and requires a cost-benefit analysis.</span></span>. The Six Sigma practices were based on Deming’s work, TQM, and others and had similarities regarding continuous efforts at improvement involving everyone at the company. It emphasized a clear focus on achieving quantifiable financial returns from any Six Sigma project. To determine the financial return on a quality initiative, the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">cost of quality (COQ)</a><span class="glossdef">Total cost of efforts to improve quality plus the cost of failure.</span></span> must be determined. The cost of quality has two parts: the cost of prevention and the cost of failure (or nonconformance). The cost of quality is the sum of the  cost of prevention and the cost of failure. If spending more on prevention reduces the cost of failure by an even greater amount, the total cost of quality is reduced.</p>

The name Six Sigma refers to a process that has six standard deviations from the mean to either control limit that would ensure virtually zero defects. (In practice, the Six Sigma approach allows for a 1.5 sigma drift, so it is really a 4.5 sigma standard that allows approximately 3.4 defects per million products.) This approach was adopted by Jack Welch at General Electric with great success. By the late 1990s, about two-thirds of the top five hundred companies in the United States had begun Six Sigma projects, including Ford, which had allowed its quality programs to slip.

        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s03_p01">Project quality refers to two distinct aspects of the project. Project quality can refer to the quality of the product or service delivered by the project. Does the end product meet client specifications? For example, does a software development project develop a program that performs to the client’s requirements? A software program that performs the basic work functions but does not integrate with existing software would not be considered a quality product, as long as the client specified that the software must interface with existing software.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s03_p02">Project quality can also refer to managing the project efficiently and effectively. Almost any client specification can be met if the project manager has unlimited time and resources. Recall that high quality means meeting the requirements for a particular grade while providing value. Meeting project deliverables within the time and resource constraints is also a measure of project quality. Developing a project execution plan that matches the complexity level of the project is the most critical aspect in developing a project plan that meets project specifications within the time frame and at the lowest costs. These two aspects of project quality have similarities and differences to quality as applied to parent organizations.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Similarities</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s03_s01_p01">All successful quality programs have (1) a requirement for commitment to quality by all the employees and their partners and (2) an emphasis on error prevention and client satisfaction. To comply with TQM, Six Sigma, ISO, or other quality standards required by the client or by the project management firm, the project manager must engage in quality programs and provide documents that specifically comply with the quality standards in use. For example, a project is typically required to follow the parent organization’s work processes related to procurement and document management. Any project processes that interface with the organization’s quality processes will be required to meet the quality standards of the organization.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s03_s01_p02">If a large project involves repetitive processes such as welding or pouring concrete, statistical processes control methods can be used to maintain the quality of the product. These processes control methods are similar to those used by process managers in the manufacturing environment. The intent is for the work of the project to meet design specifications. The welding tools and equipment must be sufficient to perform the welds established in the welding specifications, and the welds must be tested, usually by an independent tester, to assure the end product meets the design specifications. The civil engineers design a concrete pour to meet certain criteria that will support a structure. The criteria, detailed in the design specifications, provide the parameters that the construction crew must meet when pouring the concrete. On large projects, which sometimes have thousands of welds and hundreds of yards of concrete to pour, the use of quality control tools and methods are critical to meeting design specifications</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s03_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Differences</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s03_s02_p01">Because projects are temporary, spotting trends in samples produced by repetitive processes is not as important as considering quality in the planning of the project. Instead, the project manager must be able to provide documentation that demonstrates that the correct processes are in place to prevent quality failures.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s03_s02_p02">The cost of quality (COQ) must be considered in the scope document and the project budget. If the group or company that is providing the project management is separate from the client, the project budget will bear the cost of prevention while the client will reap the rewards of avoiding the costs of failure. If senior management does not recognize the benefit to the organization of reducing cost of failure by spending more on prevention during the project, the project manager can be placed in the position of producing a product or service that he or she knows could be of higher quality.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s03_s02_p03">If the cost of quality is not specifically considered and approved by senior management in the scope of the project, quality might be sacrificed during the project to meet budget goals.</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s03_s02_n01">
            <h3 class="title">Cost of Quality in an Energy Management System</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s03_s02_p04">At a midwestern university, a new building was being built, but it was over budget. To reduce the cost of the energy management system and avoid a late penalty, the project manager installed a cheaper energy management system. The less expensive system could not reduce power to the air circulation fans during peak electrical price periods, and it was not compatible with other campus systems. Five years after the building was built, when a central control unit was installed to coordinate building energy consumption, the incompatible system was replaced because it could not communicate with the central campus energy control system or save as much in electrical costs. The university did not take the time to specify the quality of the building control system in the scope statement and was not aware of the implication of the substitution at the time it was made. As a result, the cost of quality was lower in the prevention category but much higher in the cost of failure category. Because the parties acted in their own interests instead of the interest of the total university and quality was not a team effort, waste occurred and total cost increased.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s03_s02_p05">Some separation of responsibility for quality is necessary. For example, if a project is undertaken to build a facility that makes something, it is important to distinguish between the quality of the work done by the project team and the quality of the items produced after the project is over. The client provides specifications for the facility that should result in production of quality products. It is the client’s responsibility to provide appropriate project requirements that will result in a facility that can produce quality products. It is the project manager’s responsibility to meet the project requirements. The project manager must focus on meeting requirements for project activities, but as part of the quality team, opportunities to improve the quality of the final product should be discussed with the client. If the final products fail to meet quality standards, someone will be blamed for the failure. It could be the project manager, even if he or she met all the requirements of the project specified by the client.</p>

It uses its own human resources department to handle the selection and hiring of the employees, but it contracts with a nearby technical college to provide some of the training. The technical college is responsible for designing and delivering training on the topic of plant safety practices. The objective of the training project is to reduce the number of workplace accidents, but that is not the characteristic by which the quality of the training program is determined because the rate of accidents for employees who go through the training will not be known until after they have been employed for months or years. The criteria for determining the quality of the training must be something that can be controlled and measured by the project manager during the project.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s03_s02_p07">Because projects are time sensitive, meeting activity finish dates is a common characteristic of quality work on a project that is not typical of a requirement of a process manager.</p>

The vendor for supplying fuel is required to provide fuel in the right grades for the various vehicles, in the appropriate quantities, and in a timely manner. If fuel of the right type and grade, with acceptable levels of impurities, is delivered a week after the vehicles have run out of fuel, the work on the fuel-delivery activity is of low quality.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Measurement Terminology</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s04_s01_p01">During the execution phase of the project, services and products are sampled and measured to determine if the quality is within control limits for the requirements and to analyze causes for variations. This evaluation is often done by a separate quality control group, and knowledge of a few process measurement terms is necessary to understand their reports. Several of these terms are similar, and it is valuable to know the distinction between them.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s04_s01_p02">The quality plan specifies the control limits of the product or process; the size of the range between those limits is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">tolerance</a><span class="glossdef">Variation allowed on either side of the mean, often shown with the ± symbol to mean plus or minus.</span></span>. Tolerances are often written as the mean value, plus or minus the tolerance. The plus and minus signs are written together, ±.</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s04_s01_n01">

            <p class="para" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s04_s01_p03">The petroleum refinery chose to set its control limits for 87 octane gasoline at 86 and 88 octane. The tolerance is 87 ± 1.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s04_s01_p04">Tools are selected that can measure the samples closely enough to determine if the measurements are within control limits and if they are showing a trend. Each measurement tool has its own tolerances. For example, if a machine is making rods whose diameters should be 10 mm ± 0.01 mm, you need a measuring device that can accommodate a rod that is 10 mm wide but can measure that width to a much smaller tolerance than 0.01 mm, such as 0.001 mm.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s04_s01_p05">The choice of tolerance directly affects the cost of quality (COQ). In general, it costs more to produce and measure products that have small tolerances. The costs associated with making products with small tolerances for variation can be very high and not proportional to the gains. For example, it might double the manufacturing cost to improve a process from a 4 σ to a 5 σ (lower tolerances from 25 percent of control limits to 20 percent), which might only reduce the number of parts that are out of control from 4 per 100,000 to 6 per 10 million (see <a class="xref" href="fwk-38087-ch10_s01#fwk-38087-ch10_s01_s02_f04">Figure 10.4 "Meaning of Sigma Levels"</a>). The cost of failure of only 4 parts per 100,000 might be much less than the cost of prevention.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s04_s02_p01">Clients provide specifications for the project that must be met for the project to be successful. Meeting project specifications is one definition of a project success. Clients often have expectations that are more difficult to capture in a written specification. For example, one client will want to be invited to every meeting of the project and will then select the ones that seem most relevant. Another client will want to only be invited to project meetings that need client input. Inviting this client to every meeting will cause unnecessary frustration. Listening to the client and developing an understanding of the expectations that are not easily captured in specifications is important to meeting the client’s expectations.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s04_s02_p02">Project surveys that capture how the client perceives the project performance provide the project team with data that is useful in meeting client expectation. If the results of the surveys indicate that the client is not pleased with some aspect of the project, the project team has the opportunity to explore the reasons for this perception with the client and develop recovery plans. The survey can also help define what is going well and what needs improved.</p>

Some quality management programs, like Six Sigma, require that expenditures for quality are justified using a cost-to-benefit analysis that is similar to calculating the cost of quality, except that it is a ratio of cost of increasing quality to the resulting benefit. A cost-benefit analysis in some quality programs can take into account nonfinancial factors such as client loyalty and improvements to corporate image and the cost-to-benefit analysis takes the form of a written analysis rather than a simple numeric ratio. It is similar to determining the cost of quality (COQ).</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s07_s01_p01">Real production processes are never perfect. In some cases, a few products that are too small or that do not work will just cause inconvenience, but in other cases they might be life threatening. Samples of the production process will show how much variation occurs. If it appears that the variations are distributed equally above and below the mean (average), it might be assumed that the statistics of a normal distribution can be used to predict the percentage of products that will be defective when many of them are produced even if none of the samples are defective.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s07_s01_p02">Some projects are initiated to increase the quality by reducing the variation in production. To understand the language of statistics and how it is used to justify a project, it is useful to gain a “feel” for how the distribution of samples is described by the standard deviation. A spreadsheet can be used to simulate samples of production runs where the mean and standard deviation can be chosen to show their relationship in a normal distribution. By trying different values for the standard deviation and observing the effect on the distribution of estimated samples in a chart, you can develop a sense of how the two are related.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s07_s01_p03">Recall that a standard deviation is called a sigma and represented by the Greek letter <em class="emphasis">σ</em> and the 68-95-99.7 rule refers to the percentage of samples that will be within one, two, and three standard deviations of the mean.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Recognizing Variations Due to Unassignable and Assignable Causes</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s07_s02_p01">W. Edwards Deming teaches that some variation is inevitable due to chance cause. A manager needs to recognize the difference between variations that are due to chance and those that indicate the presence of an assignable cause or a trend. If it appears that there is an assignable cause for variation in quality, a project manager might be required to identify and fix the problem. To communicate with process managers who are monitoring and sampling production, it is useful to understand the use of control charts.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s07_s02_p02">A run chart is a type of chart that shows variations from the mean as a function of time. The value of each sample is plotted to show the day it was taken and how it differs from the mean. If the variation is random, there will be roughly the same number of points above and below the mean.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s07_s02_p03">A spreadsheet can be used to simulate random variations in production. In this exercise, the spreadsheet uses its random number function to pick two numbers that are positive and two that are negative and adds them to the mean. Each number represents a variation that is between the control limits. Most of the time the positive and negative numbers cancel each other out and result in a sum that is close to the mean, but occasionally the four random factors add up to values that are far from the mean.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s07_s02_p04">In this part of the exercise, you observe variations in a run chart and frequency distribution chart that are due to random effects. You generate the random numbers several times to see what production runs with random (unassignable) variations look like.</p>

                <li>According to Deming, it is not productive to hold employees to quality standards that they do not control. Consider the effect on employee moral if this set of samples was taken as the standard by which the next run would be judged.</li>
