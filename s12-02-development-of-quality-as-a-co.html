        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s02_s01_p01">Prior to the late 1700s, products such as firearms and clocks were made as individual works where the parts were adjusted to each other so they could work together. If a part broke, a new one had to be made by hand to fit. In 1790 in France, Honoré Blanc demonstrated that he could make musket parts so nearly identical that a musket could be assembled from bins of parts chosen at random.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38087-fn10_002">Ken Alder, “Innovation and Amnesia: Engineering Rationality and the Fate of Interchangeable Parts Manufacturing in France,” <em class="emphasis">Technology and Culture</em> 38, no 2 (April 1997): 273–311.</span> The practice of making parts to a high level of accuracy in their dimensions and finishes made the parts interchangeable. The use of interchangeable parts became the founding principle of assembly line manufacturing to produce all manner of goods from sewing machines to automobiles. The manufacturers of firearms and weapons were often the leaders in improving quality because reliable and safe operation of weapons and their rapid repair is a matter of life and death.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s02_s02_p01">During World War II, factories were converted from manufacturing consumer goods to weapons. War plants had to make large numbers of parts as fast as possible while doing it safely for the workers and for the service members who used them. Important improvements in <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">quality control (QC)</a><span class="glossdef">Management of production standards through statistical interpretation of random product measurements.</span></span>—the management of production standards through statistical interpretation of random product measurements, which emphasizes consistency and accuracy—were made during this period. A key figure in the history of quality management who was an important person in the war effort was Walter Shewhart at Bell Telephone Laboratories. Shewhart recognized that real processes seldom behaved like theoretical random distributions and tended to change with time. He separated causes of variation into two categories: <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">chance cause</a><span class="glossdef">Variation due to random events.</span></span> and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">assignable cause</a><span class="glossdef">Variations that can be attributed to a particular event or influence.</span></span>. Chance causes could be ignored if they did not cause too much variation, and trying to eliminate them often made the problem worse, but assignable causes could be fixed. To help distinguish between variations caused by random events and trends that indicated assignable causes, Shewhart introduced the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">control chart</a><span class="glossdef">Scatter chart with time on the horizontal axis and measurement scale on the vertical axis. It also displays the mean and control limits. It may mark two standard deviations from the mean.</span></span>, which is also known as a type of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">run chart</a><span class="glossdef">Chart of measurements that shows variations as the process progresses in time.</span></span> because data are collected while the process is running. A control chart has time on the bottom axis and a plot of sample measurements. The mean, upper control limit, lower control limit, and warning lines that are two sigma from the mean are indicated by horizontal lines.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s02_s03_p01">The most influential person in modern quality control was an American who was a hero in Japan but virtually unknown in the United States. W. Edwards Deming worked with Shewhart at Bell Labs and helped apply Shewhart’s ideas to American manufacturing processes during World War II. Following the war, American factories returned to the production of consumer goods. Many of the other major manufacturing centers in the world had been damaged by bombing during the war and took time to recover. Without the safety needs of wartime and with little competition, quality control was not a high priority for American companies.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38087-fn10_003">John Dowd, “How the Japanese Learned to Compete,” <em class="emphasis">Asia Times</em>, October 27, 2006, <a class="link" href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Japan/HJ27Dh01.html">http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Japan/HJ27Dh01.html</a> (accessed August 11, 2009).</span> Management in the United States focused on increasing production to meet demand and lowering costs to increase profits.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s02_s03_p02">After the war, while the United States occupied Japan, Deming was asked by the U.S. Department of the Army to assist with the statistics of the 1950 census in Japan. Kenichi Koyanagi, the managing director of the Union of Japanese Scientists and Engineers and a very influential industrialist, asked Deming to speak to twenty-one top industrial leaders on the topic of global strategy for Japanese industry. Deming went beyond Shewhart’s work and talked about his philosophy of quality manufacturing and how the responsibility for quality begins with management. He explained that a corporate culture devoted to producing high-quality products would result in less waste, lower costs, greater client loyalty, and greater market share. With Koyanagi’s support, Deming’s ideas were widely adopted by these influential leaders.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s02_s03_p03">Deming described his philosophy as a system of profound knowledge, which has four parts:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s02_s03_l01">

It was not until 1980 that America became aware of Deming when his work was described in an NBC documentary titled <em class="emphasis">If Japan Can, Why Can’t We</em>?<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38087-fn10_004">John Dowd, “How the Japanese Learned to Compete,” <em class="emphasis">Asia Times</em>, October 27, 2006, <a class="link" href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Japan/HJ27Dh01.html">http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Japan/HJ27Dh01.html</a> (accessed August 11, 2009).</span> By then, Deming was eighty years old and the producer of the show originally assumed he was dead.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38087-fn10_005">Thomas J.

Edwards Deming, <em class="emphasis">Out of the Crisis</em> (Boston: MIT Press, 1982).</span> It was aimed at explaining his system to American manufacturers and the American public. In the book, Deming described fourteen principles of management to guide the implementation of his philosophy. Some of them were challenges to Western managers and very different from the thinking that was prevalent at the time. In brief, they are as follows:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s02_s04_l01">
            <li>Create constancy of purpose toward improvement of product and service.</li>
            <li>Adopt a new philosophy. We are in a new economic age. Western management must awaken to the challenge, learn their responsibilities, and take on leadership for a change.</li>
            <li>Cease dependence on inspection to achieve quality. Eliminate the need for inspection on a mass basis by building quality into the product in the first place.</li>
            <li>End the practice of awarding business on the basis of price tag. Instead, minimize cost. Move toward a single supplier for any one item, on a long-term relationship of loyalty and trust.</li>
            <li>Improve constantly and forever the system of production and service to improve quality and productivity and thus constantly decrease costs.</li>
            <li>Institute training on the job.</li>
            <li>Institute leadership. The aim of supervision should be to help people and machines and gadgets to do a better job. Supervision of management is in need of overhaul, as well as supervision of production workers.</li>
            <li>Drive out fear, so that everyone may work effectively for the company.</li>
            <li>Break down barriers between departments.</li>
            <li>Eliminate slogans, exhortations, and targets for the workforce asking for zero defects and new levels of productivity.</li>
            <li>Eliminate work standards (quotas) on the factory floor. Substitute leadership.</li>
            <li>Remove barriers that rob the hourly worker of his right to pride of workmanship.</li>
            <li>Institute a vigorous program of education and self-improvement.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s02_s04_p05">According to Peter B. Petersen,<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38087-fn10_011">Peter B. Petersen, “Total Quality Management and the Deming Approach to Quality Management,” <em class="emphasis">Journal of Management History</em> 5, no. 8 (1999): 468–88.</span> TQM differs from the Deming approach in four fundamental ways:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s02_s04_l03">
            <li>The Deming approach represents one philosophy that is used in its entirety or not at all. In contrast, TQM can be tailored to a particular environment.</li>
            <li>Both agree that a long-term commitment is required by top management. However, Deming would drop clients if they started to wane, while TQM consultants were less demanding.</li>
            <li>Deming insists on constancy of purpose, while TQM adapts to the situation, which results in lack of constancy.</li>
            <li>Deming requires adoption of his principles of profound knowledge, while TQM lacks this unified philosophy.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s02_s04_p06">Many poorly qualified consulting firms provided training in TQM to American companies. The approach worked in some cases but not in others where it was applied superficially, and the movement’s credibility was diminished.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s02_s04_p07">Another approach to quality management in the United States was formulated at Motorola in 1986 and was named <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Six Sigma (6σ)</a><span class="glossdef">Quality management system that give titles to specialists and requires a cost-benefit analysis.</span></span>. The Six Sigma practices were based on Deming’s work, TQM, and others and had similarities regarding continuous efforts at improvement involving everyone at the company. It emphasized a clear focus on achieving quantifiable financial returns from any Six Sigma project. To determine the financial return on a quality initiative, the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">cost of quality (COQ)</a><span class="glossdef">Total cost of efforts to improve quality plus the cost of failure.</span></span> must be determined. The cost of quality has two parts: the cost of prevention and the cost of failure (or nonconformance). The cost of quality is the sum of the  cost of prevention and the cost of failure. If spending more on prevention reduces the cost of failure by an even greater amount, the total cost of quality is reduced.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s02_s04_p08">Six Sigma identified individuals as experts in quality and awarded titles like Champion and Master Black Belt. The name Six Sigma refers to a process that has six standard deviations from the mean to either control limit that would ensure virtually zero defects. (In practice, the Six Sigma approach allows for a 1.5 sigma drift, so it is really a 4.5 sigma standard that allows approximately 3.4 defects per million products.) This approach was adopted by Jack Welch at General Electric with great success. By the late 1990s, about two-thirds of the top five hundred companies in the United States had begun Six Sigma projects, including Ford, which had allowed its quality programs to slip. To provide encouragement and a consistent standard, the U.S. government created the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award</a><span class="glossdef">U.S. award for quality named after a former secretary of commerce.</span></span> in 1987 to encourage companies to improve quality; the award was named for Malcolm Baldrige who was the U.S. secretary of commerce from 1981 to 1987.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38087-fn10_012">National Institute of Standards and Technology, “Frequently Asked Questions about the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award,” November 25, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.nist.gov/baldrige/index.cfm">http://www.nist.gov/baldrige/index.cfm</a> (accessed August 14, 2009).</span> The criteria used to determine award winners are as follows:</p>

The WTO is a negotiating forum where governments can discuss ways to help trade flow as freely as possible.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38087-fn10_013">World Trade Organization, “Understanding the WTO: Basics,” <a class="link" href="http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/fact1_e.htm">http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/fact1_e.htm</a> (accessed August 14, 2009).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s02_s05_p02">Increases in trade forced companies to improve the quality of their products to compete for clients and to exchange parts reliably between companies that used parts suppliers. To assist in developing standards for quality that would be the same between countries, an organization of 158 national standards groups formed the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">International Organization for Standardization (ISO)</a><span class="glossdef">Degree to which a set of inherent characteristics fulfill requirements.</span></span>, which is headquartered in Switzerland. For example, a company might require a parts supplier to meet certain ISO standards if it wants to bid on contracts. There are thousands of ISO standards, and they are grouped by their numbers. The ISO 9000 group of standards relate to quality:</p>

                <li>The need for production of safe, reliable weapons that could be mass produced led to use of methods to assure that parts were manufactured within controlled limits. An early example is the interchangeable musket parts produced in France in 1790 and, later, the quality control methods introduced by Shewhart in the United States during World War II.</li>
                <li>Following World War II, Japanese companies followed advice from Deming and others to make quality a top priority for management. Higher-quality products gave Japan a competitive advantage with U.S. consumers that forced U.S. firms to respond with similar quality programs.</li>
                <li>The Deming award is given by Japan to companies doing business in Japan for high-quality standards. Similarly, the Baldrige National Quality Award is given to U.S. companies and individuals for their contribution to quality.</li>
                <li>Total quality management is a flexible program that is adapted from Japanese practices that emphasize <em class="emphasis">kaizen</em>, participation by all; <em class="emphasis">atarimaie hinshitsu</em>, making things work the way they should; <em class="emphasis">kansei</em>, learning from the way the client uses the product to make improvements; and <em class="emphasis">miryokuteki hinshitsu</em>, giving products an aesthetic quality to make them pleasing to use. Six Sigma identifies specialists within the organization and assigns titles like Master Black Belt. Each quality project must evaluate the cost of quality to gain approval.</li>
                <li>The International Standards Institute devises guidelines for establishing practices. The ISO 9000 group are guidelines for establishing practices that are likely to create quality products.</li>
                <li>The cost of quality has two parts: the cost of prevention and the cost of failure. The cost of prevention includes costs to establish quality practices and the costs to verify them. The cost of failure includes internal costs before the product is sold, such as waste and fixing products, while external costs include those that occur after the product is sold, such as returns and lawsuits.</li>
