Deming stresses that management is 85 percent of the problem and the solution to a company’s quality.

Based on your experience with the management of your school, does the management use the principles of <em class="emphasis">kaizen</em>, <em class="emphasis">atarimae hinshitsu</em>, <em class="emphasis">kansei</em>, and <em class="emphasis">miryokuteki hinshitsu</em>? Provide an example (or counter example) of each.</li>
