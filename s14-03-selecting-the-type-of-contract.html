    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s03_p01">An agreement between the organization and an outside provider of a service or materials is a legal <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">contract</a><span class="glossdef">An agreement that is legally enforceable.</span></span>. To limit misunderstandings and make them more enforceable, contracts are usually written documents that describe the obligations of both parties.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s03_p02">Because legal agreements often create risk for the parent organization, procurement activities are often guided by the policies and procedures of the parent organization. After the project management team develops an understanding of what portions of the project work will be outsourced and defines the type of relationships that are needed to support the project execution plan, the procurement team begins to develop the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">contracting plan</a><span class="glossdef">Defines the relationship between the project and the subcontractors—supplier, vendor, or partner—and also defines a process for making changes in the agreement.</span></span>. On smaller, less complex projects, the contract development and execution is typically managed through the parent company or by a part-time person assigned to the project. On larger, more complex projects, the procurement team can consist of work teams within the procurement function with special expertise in contracting. The contract plan defines the relationship between the project and the subcontractors (supplier, vendor, or partner) and also defines a process for making changes in the agreement to accommodate changes that will occur on the project. This change management process is similar to the change management process used with the project agreement with the project client.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s03_p03">The contracting plan of the project supports the procurement approach of the project. The following are some factors to consider when selecting the type of contract:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s03_l02">
        <li>The uncertainty of the scope of work needed</li>
        <li>The party assuming the risk of unexpected cost increases</li>
        <li>The importance of meeting the scheduled milestone dates</li>
        <li>The need for predictable project costs</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s03_p04">There are several types of contracting approaches and each supports different project environments and project approaches. The legal contracts that support the procurement plan consist of two general types of contract: the fixed price and the cost reimbursable contracts, with variations on each main type.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Fixed Price Contracts</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s03_s01_p01">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">fixed price contract</a><span class="glossdef">A type of contract that pays a contractor an amount that is agreed upon at the start of the project.</span></span> is a legal agreement between the project organization and an entity (person or company) to provide goods or services to the project at an agreed-on price. The contract usually details the quality of the goods or services, the timing needed to support the project, and the price for delivering goods or services. There are several variations of the fixed price contract. For commodities and goods and services where the scope of work is very clear and not likely to change, the fixed price contract offers a predictable cost. The responsibility for managing the work to meet the needs of the project is focused on the contractor. The project team tracks the quality and schedule progress to assure the contractors will meet the project needs. The risks associated with fixed price contracts are the costs associated with project change. If a change occurs on the project that requires a change order from the contractor, the price of the change is typically very high. Even when the price for changes is included in the original contract, changes on a fixed price contract will create higher total project costs than other forms of contracts because the majority of the cost risk is transferred to the contractor, and most contractors will add a contingency to the contract to cover their additional risk.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s03_s01_p02">Fixed price contracts require the availability of at least two or more suppliers that have the qualifications and performance histories that assure the needs of the project can be met. The other requirement is a scope of work that is most likely not going to change. Developing a clear scope of work based on good information, creating a list of highly qualified bidders, and developing a clear contract that reflects that scope of work are critical aspects of a good fixed priced contract.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Fixed Total Cost Contract</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s03_s01_s01_p01">If the service provider is responsible for incorporating all costs, including profit, into the agreed-on price, it is a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">fixed total cost contract</a><span class="glossdef">The service provider is responsible for incorporating all costs, including profit, into the agreed-on price.</span></span>.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s03_s01_s02_p01">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">fixed price contract with price adjustment</a><span class="glossdef">The service provider is allowed an adjustment for economic changes that affect costs such as changes in currency values or inflation.</span></span> is used for unusually long projects that span years. The most common use of this type of contract is the inflation-adjusted price. In some countries, the value of its local currency can vary greatly in a few months, which affects the cost of local materials and labor. In periods of high inflation, the client assumes risk of higher costs due to inflation, and the contract price is adjusted based on an inflation index. The volatility of certain commodities can also be accounted for in a price adjustment contract. For example, if the price of oil significantly affects the costs of the project, the client can accept the oil price volatility risk and include a provision in the contract that would allow the contract price adjustment based on a change in the price of oil.</p>

The contract might include an incentive for completing the work on an important milestone for the project. Often contracts have a penalty clause if the work is not performed according to the contract. For example, if the new software is not completed in time to support the start-up of a new plant, the contract might penalize the software company a daily amount of money for every day the software is late. This type of penalty is often used when the software is critical to the project and the delay will cost the project significant money.</p>

This is an example of a unit price contract. If the project only uses 970 CY, then the total costs will be lower. If the project uses 1,050 CY, then the costs will be higher.</p>

The fee can be either a percent or an amount.</span></span>. Cost reimbursable contracts are most often used when the scope of work or the costs for performing the work are not well known. The project uses a cost reimbursable contract to pay the contractor for allowable expenses related to performing the work. Since the cost of the project is reimbursable, the contractor has much less risk associated with cost increases. When the costs of the work are not well known, a cost reimbursable contract reduces the amount of money the bidders place in the bid to account for the risk associated with potential increases in costs.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s03_s02_p02">The contractor is also less motivated to find ways to reduce the cost of the project unless there are incentives for supporting the accomplishment of project goals.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s03_s02_s05_p03">To minimize the risk to the project, the contract typically includes a not-to-exceed amount, which means the contract can only charge up to the agree amount. The T&amp;M contract allows the project to make adjustments as more information is available. The final cost of the work is not known until sufficient information is available to complete a more accurate estimate.</p>

                <p class="para" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s03_s02_s05_p04">On a road construction project, the survey team discovers an archeological site. Contractors are required to preserve archeological sites and the project team explores ways to advance the schedule while a decision is made on how to handle the site. The project issues a T&amp;M contract to an archeologist to determine the nature of the site and develop a plan to preserve the integrity of the site. A T&amp;M contract is awarded because the size and character of the site is unknown and the amount of time and the type of equipment needed to explore the site is also unknown.</p>
                <p class="para" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s03_s02_s05_p05">An archeologist from the local university was issued a T&amp;M contract to cover the labor and expenses to explore the site and develop a plan. An hourly rate was established for each member of the five-person archeological team. Equipment rental fees plus 15 percent was paid on all equipment rented and supplies used. The archeological team’s profit was incorporated into the labor rates.</p>
                <p class="para" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s03_s02_s05_p06">A not-to-exceed amount was also included in the contract to capture the team’s estimate of the amount of work. A contract change order would increase the not-to-exceed number when more information was available.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Progress Payments and Change Management</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s03_s03_p01">Vendors and suppliers usually require payments during the life of the contract. On contracts that last several months, the contractor will incur significant cost and will want the project to pay for these costs as early as possible. Rather than wait until the end of the contract, a schedule of payments is typically developed as part of the contract and is connected to the completion of a defined amount of work or project milestones. These payments made before the end of the project and based on the progress of the work are called progress payments. For example, a concrete supplier on a construction project may bill the contract for the amount of concrete poured the previous month plus the profit earned during that period. On a training project, the contract might develop a payment schedule that pays for the development of the curriculum, and payment is made when the curriculum is completed and accepted. In each case, there is a defined amount of work to be accomplished, a time frame for accomplishing that work, and a quality standard the work must achieve before the contractor is paid for the work.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch12_s03_s03_p02">Just as the project has a scope of work that defines what is included in the project and what work is outside the project, vendors and suppliers have a scope of work that defines what they will produce or supply to the company. (Partners typically share the project scope of work and may not have a separate scope of work.) Often changes occur on the project that require changes in the contractor’s scope of work. How these changes will be managed during the life of the project is typically documented in the contract. Capturing these changes early, documenting what changed and how the change impacted the contract, and developing a change order (a change to the contract) are important to maintaining the progress of the project. Conflict among team members will often arise when changes are not documented or when the team cannot agree on the change. Developing and implementing an effective change management process for contractors and key suppliers will minimize this conflict and the potential negative effect on the project.</p>

                <li>Contract selection is based on uncertainty of scope, assignment of risk, need for predictable costs, and the importance of meeting milestone dates.</li>
                <li>Total fixed cost is a single price where the scope is well defined. A fixed price with incentive contract offers a reward for finishing early or under budget or a penalty for being late. A fixed price with adjustment allows for increases in cost of materials or changes in currency values. A fixed unit price contract sets a price per unit, but the exact number of units is not known.</li>
                <li>In a cost reimbursable contract, the project pays for costs. A cost plus fixed fee contract assures the contractor of a known fee. A cost plus percentage fee calculates the fee as a percentage of the costs. A cost plus incentive fee sets goals for the contractor to achieve that would result in a bonus. A cost plus award fee is similar, but the goals are more subjective. Time and materials contracts pay for costs plus an hourly rate for the contractor’s time.</li>
