        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch09_s01_s01_p01">During the conceptual phase when project selection occurs, economic factors are an important consideration when choosing between competing projects. To compare the simple paybacks or internal rates of return between projects, an estimate of the cost of each project is made. The estimates must be accurate enough so that the comparisons are meaningful, but the amount of time and resources used to make the estimates should be appropriate to the size and complexity of the project. The methods used to estimate the cost of the project during the selection phase are generally faster and consume fewer resources than those used to create detailed estimates in later phases. They rely more on the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">expert judgment</a><span class="glossdef">Decisions based on incomplete information made by people who have extensive personal experience.</span></span> of experienced managers who can make accurate estimates with less detailed information. Estimates in the earliest stages of project selection are usually made using estimates based from previous projects that can be adjusted—<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">scaled</a><span class="glossdef">Multiplied by an adjustment factor to make the new estimate proportional to the original.</span></span>—to match the size and complexity of the current project or by applying standardized formulas.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Analogous Estimate</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch09_s01_s01_s01_p01">An estimate that is based on other project estimates is an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">analogous estimate</a><span class="glossdef">Budget estimate based on a similar project.</span></span>. If a similar project cost a certain amount, then it is reasonable to assume that the current project will cost about the same. Few projects are exactly the same size and complexity, so the estimate must be adjusted upward or downward to account for the difference. The selection of projects that are similar and the amount of adjustment needed is up to the judgment of the person who makes the estimate. Normally, this judgment is based on many years of experience estimating projects, including incorrect estimates that were learning experiences for the expert.</p>

                <p class="para" id="fwk-38087-ch09_s01_s01_s01_p02">In the John’s move example, John asked a friend for advice about the cost of his move. His friend replied, “I moved from an apartment a little smaller than yours last year and the distance was about the same. I did it with a fourteen-foot truck. It cost about $575 for the truck rental, pads, hand truck, rope, boxes, and gas.” Because of the similarity of the projects, John’s initial estimate of the cost of the move was less than $700 and he decided that the cost would be affordable and the project could go forward.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch09_s01_s01_s01_p03">Less experienced managers who are required to make analogous estimates can look through the documentation that is available from previous projects. If those projects were evaluated using the Darnall-Preston Complexity Index (DPCI), the manager can quickly identify projects that have similar profiles to the project under consideration even if those projects were managed by other people. Comparing the original estimates with the final project costs on several previous projects with the same DPCI ratings gives a less experienced manager the perspective that it would take many years to acquire by trial and error. It also provides references the manager can use to justify the estimate.</p>

If the estimates by the vendors are much higher than expected, and if the project cannot be completed for the cost that was used to select the project, the selection decision might have to be reconsidered. Reconsidering the selection of the project should take into consideration the economic ratings of the competing projects that were not chosen and who the project champions are for the projects that would be affected.</p>

The money needed to pay for a project is usually transferred to the project account shortly before it is needed. These transfers must be timed so that the money is there to pay for each activity without causing a delay in the start of the activity. If the money is transferred too far in advance, the organization will lose the opportunity to use the money somewhere else, or they will have to pay unnecessary interest charges if the money is borrowed. A schedule of money transfers is created that should match the need to pay for the activities. The process of matching the schedule of transfers with the schedule of activity payments is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">reconciliation</a><span class="glossdef">Matching funds provided with funds spent.</span></span>.
