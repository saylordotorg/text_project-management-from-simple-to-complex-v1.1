        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s07_s01_p01">Real production processes are never perfect. In some cases, a few products that are too small or that do not work will just cause inconvenience, but in other cases they might be life threatening. Samples of the production process will show how much variation occurs. If it appears that the variations are distributed equally above and below the mean (average), it might be assumed that the statistics of a normal distribution can be used to predict the percentage of products that will be defective when many of them are produced even if none of the samples are defective.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s07_s01_p02">Some projects are initiated to increase the quality by reducing the variation in production. To understand the language of statistics and how it is used to justify a project, it is useful to gain a “feel” for how the distribution of samples is described by the standard deviation. A spreadsheet can be used to simulate samples of production runs where the mean and standard deviation can be chosen to show their relationship in a normal distribution. By trying different values for the standard deviation and observing the effect on the distribution of estimated samples in a chart, you can develop a sense of how the two are related.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s07_s01_p03">Recall that a standard deviation is called a sigma and represented by the Greek letter <em class="emphasis">σ</em> and the 68-95-99.7 rule refers to the percentage of samples that will be within one, two, and three standard deviations of the mean.</p>

                <li>This worksheet is designed to simulate a set of sample values that vary from the mean for random reasons and form a normal distribution.

                        <li>Column A has bins. In this example, the bins are .1 units wide. The size of the bin and the horizontal scale of the chart are determined by the value in cell L5.</li>
                        <li>This simulation uses forty-two bins that are distributed equally above and below the mean. The mean value can be specified in cell L4.</li>
                        <li>The usual method is to sample a sequence of products, count the number that fall into each bin, and then calculate the standard deviation. In this simulation, you can specify the standard deviation in cell L3, and the percentage of samples that are likely to occur in each bin is calculated and displayed in column G. The display is rounded to a whole percent. The display of decimal places can be increased using the spreadsheet’s controls.</li>
                        <li>The percentage of estimated samples that occur in each bin is charted using a column chart. The scale at the left side of the chart indicates the percent of the samples in each bin.</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Recognizing Variations Due to Unassignable and Assignable Causes</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s07_s02_p01">W. Edwards Deming teaches that some variation is inevitable due to chance cause. A manager needs to recognize the difference between variations that are due to chance and those that indicate the presence of an assignable cause or a trend. If it appears that there is an assignable cause for variation in quality, a project manager might be required to identify and fix the problem. To communicate with process managers who are monitoring and sampling production, it is useful to understand the use of control charts.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s07_s02_p02">A run chart is a type of chart that shows variations from the mean as a function of time. The value of each sample is plotted to show the day it was taken and how it differs from the mean. If the variation is random, there will be roughly the same number of points above and below the mean.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s07_s02_p03">A spreadsheet can be used to simulate random variations in production. In this exercise, the spreadsheet uses its random number function to pick two numbers that are positive and two that are negative and adds them to the mean. Each number represents a variation that is between the control limits. Most of the time the positive and negative numbers cancel each other out and result in a sum that is close to the mean, but occasionally the four random factors add up to values that are far from the mean.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s07_s02_p04">In this part of the exercise, you observe variations in a run chart and frequency distribution chart that are due to random effects. You generate the random numbers several times to see what production runs with random (unassignable) variations look like.</p>

                <li>According to Deming, it is not productive to hold employees to quality standards that they do not control. Consider the effect on employee moral if this set of samples was taken as the standard by which the next run would be judged.</li>

                    <p class="para">Press the F9 key again and stop at a set of samples that has a greater variation, such as the example shown in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-38087-ch10_s07_s01_s01_f03">Figure 10.15 "Normal Distribution with Larger Standard Deviation"</a>.</p>

                <li>It is clear that action must be taken soon to prevent the next batch of samples from exceeding the control limit.
