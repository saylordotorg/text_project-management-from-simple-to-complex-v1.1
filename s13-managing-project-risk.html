        <h2 class="title editable block">Risk Identification</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch11_s02_s01_p01">A more disciplined process involves using checklists of potential risks and evaluating the likelihood that those events might happen on the project. Some companies and industries developed risk checklists based on experience from past projects. The Construction Industry Institute<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38087-fn11_004">Construction Industry Institute Cost/Schedule Task Force, <em class="emphasis">Management of Project Risks and Uncertainties</em> (Austin, TX: Construction Industry Institute, 1989).</span> developed a detailed checklist of potential risks based on the experience of several large construction companies executing major construction projects. These checklists can be helpful to the project manager and project team in identifying both specific risks on the checklist and expanding the thinking of the team. The past experience of the project team, project experience within the company, and experts in the industry can be valuable sources for identifying potential risk on a project.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch11_s02_s01_p02">Identifying the sources of risk by category is another method for exploring potential risk on a project. Some examples of categories for potential risks include the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch11_s02_s01_l01">
            <li>Technical</li>

            <li>Schedule</li>
            <li>Client</li>
            <li>Contractual</li>
            <li>Weather</li>
            <li>Financial</li>

            <li>Environmental</li>
            <li>People</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch11_s02_s01_p03">The people category can be subdivided into risks associated with the people. Examples of people risks include the risk of not finding the skills needed to execute the project or the sudden unavailability of key people on the project. David Hillson<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38087-fn11_005">David Hillson, “Using a Risk Breakdown Structure in Project Management,” <em class="emphasis">Journal of Facilities Management</em> 2, no. 1 (2003): 85–97.</span> uses the same framework as the work breakdown structure (WBS) for developing a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">risk breakdown structure (RBS)</a><span class="glossdef">Organization of risks associated with each activity in the work breakdown structure using a similar graphic approach.</span></span>.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Risk Evaluation</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch11_s02_s02_p01">After the potential risks have been identified, the project team then evaluates the risk based on the probability that the risk event will occur and the potential loss associated with the event. Not all risks are equal. Some risk events are more likely to happen than others, and the cost of a risk event can vary greatly. Evaluating the risk for probability of occurrence and the severity or the potential loss to the project is the next step in the risk management process.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch11_s02_s02_p02">The Construction Industry Institute conducted a study of large construction project risk evaluation and categorized risk according to the potential impact of project costs. High-impact risk consisted of risks that could increase the project costs by 5 percent of the conceptual budget or 2 percent of the detailed budget. Only thirty potential risk events met these criteria. These were the critical few potential risk events that the project management team focused on when developing a project risk mitigation or management plan. Risk evaluation is about developing an understanding of which potential risks have the greatest possibility of occurring and can have the greatest negative impact on the project. These become the critical few.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch11_s02_s02_p03">There is a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">positive correlation</a><span class="glossdef">Two variables that respond in the same way to change in their environment.</span></span>—both increase or decrease together—between project risk and project complexity. A project with new and emerging technology will have a high-complexity rating and a correspondingly high risk. The project management team will assign the appropriate resources to the technology managers to assure the accomplishment of project goals. The more complex the technology, the more resources the technology manager typically needs to meet project goals, and each of those resources could face unexpected problems.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch11_s02_s02_p04">Risk evaluation often occurs in a workshop setting. Building on the identification of the risks, each risk event is analyzed to determine the likelihood of occurring and the potential cost if it did occur. The likelihood and impact are both rated as high, medium, or low. A risk mitigation plan addresses the items that have high ratings on both factors—likelihood and impact.</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch11_s02_s02_n01">
            <h3 class="title">Risk Analysis of Equipment Delivery</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-38087-ch11_s02_s02_p05">For example, a project team analyzed the risk of some important equipment not arriving to the project on time. The team identified three pieces of equipment that were critical to the project and would significantly increase the costs of the project if they were late in arriving. One of the vendors, who was selected to deliver an important piece of equipment, had a history of being late on other projects. The vendor was good and often took on more work than it could deliver on time. This risk event (the identified equipment arriving late) was rated as high likelihood with a high impact. The other two pieces of equipment were potentially a high impact on the project but with a low probably of occurring.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch11_s02_s02_p06">Not all project mangers conduct a formal risk assessment on the project. There are barriers to identifying risks. David Parker and Alison Mobey<span class="footnote" id="fwk-38087-fn11_006">David Parker and Alison Mobey, “Action Research to Explore Perceptions of Risk in Project Management,” <em class="emphasis">International Journal of Productivity and Performance Management</em> 53, no. 1 (2004): 18–32.</span> found in a phenomenological study of project managers that there was a low understanding of the tools and benefits of a structured analysis of project risks. The lack of formal risk management tools was seen as a barrier to implementing a risk management program. The level of investment in formal risk management was also associated with managerial psychological dimensions.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch11_s02_s02_p07">Some project managers are more <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">proactive</a><span class="glossdef">Making decisions and taking action to anticipate an expected difficulty.</span></span> and will develop elaborate risk management programs for their projects. Other managers are <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">reactive</a><span class="glossdef">Making decisions and taking action in response to events.</span></span> and are more confident in their ability to handle unexpected events without prior planning, while some managers are <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">risk averse</a><span class="glossdef">A project manager or decision maker who avoids taking risks.</span></span> and prefer to be optimistic and not consider risks or to avoid taking risks whenever possible.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch11_s02_s02_p08">On projects with a low complexity profile, the project manager may informally track items that may be considered risk items. On more complex projects, the project management team may develop a list of items perceived to be higher risk and track them during project reviews. On projects with greater complexity, the process for evaluating risk is more formal with a risk assessment meeting or series of meetings during the life of the project to assess risks at different phases of the project. On highly complex projects, an outside expert may be included in the risk assessment process, and the risk assessment plan may take a more prominent place in the project execution plan.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch11_s02_s02_p09">On complex projects, statistical models are sometimes used to evaluate risk because there are too many different possible combinations of risks to calculate them one at a time. One example of the statistical model used on projects is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Monte Carlo simulation</a><span class="glossdef">A simulation that uses statistical processes to evaluate risk.</span></span>, which simulates a possible range of outcomes by trying many different combinations of risks based on their likelihood. The output from a Monte Carlo simulation provides the project team with the probability of an event occurring within a range and for combinations of events. For example, the typical output from a Monte Carol simulation may reflect that there is a 10 percent chance that one of the three important pieces of equipment will be late and that the weather will also be unusually bad after the equipment arrives.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Risk Mitigation</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch11_s02_s03_p01">After the risk has been identified and evaluated, the project team develops a risk mitigation plan, which is a plan to reduce the impact of an unexpected event. The project team mitigates risks in the following ways:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch11_s02_s03_l01">
            <li>Risk avoidance</li>

        </ul>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch11_s02_s03_p02">Each of these mitigation techniques can be an effective tool in reducing individual risks and the risk profile of the project. The risk mitigation plan captures the risk mitigation approach for each identified risk event and the actions the project management team will take to reduce or eliminate the risk.</p>
        <div class="section" id="fwk-38087-ch11_s02_s03_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Risk Avoidance</h2>

A common risk avoidance technique is to use proven and existing technologies rather than adopt new techniques, even though the new techniques may show promise of better performance or lower costs. A project team may choose a vendor with a proven track record over a new vendor that is providing significant price incentives to avoid the risk of working with a new vendor. The project team that requires drug testing for team members is practicing risk avoidance by avoiding damage done by someone under the influence of drugs.</p>

Many organizations that work on international projects will reduce political, legal, labor, and others risk types associated with international projects by developing a joint venture with a company located in that country. Partnering with another company to share the risk associated with a portion of the project is advantageous when the other company has expertise and experience the project team does not have. If the risk event does occur, then the partnering company absorbs some or all of the negative impact of the event. The company will also derive some of the profit or benefit gained by a successful project.</p>

                <p class="para" id="fwk-38087-ch11_s02_s03_s02_p02">One example of risk sharing is a large United States construction firm that won a contract to build a pipeline in Peru. The company partnered with a construction company in Peru with a reputation for performing on time. The Peruvian company brought local expertise and the U.S. company contributed the latest construction methods. If the project had not successfully completed on time, both companies would have received less profit, but the project was successful and both companies met profit targets.</p>

On international projects, companies will often purchase the guarantee of a currency rate to reduce the risk associated with fluctuations in the currency exchange rate. A project manager may hire an expert to review the technical plans or the cost estimate on a project to increase the confidence in that plan and reduce the project risk. Assigning highly skilled project personnel to manage the high-risk activities is another risk reduction method. Experts managing a high-risk activity can often predict problems and find solutions that prevent the activities from having a negative impact on the project. Some companies reduce risk by forbidding key executives or technology experts to ride on the same airplane.</p>

The purchase of insurance on certain items is a risk transfer method. The risk is transferred from the project to the insurance company. A construction project in the Caribbean may purchase hurricane insurance that would cover the cost of a hurricane damaging the construction site. The purchase of insurance is usually in areas outside the control of the project team. Weather, political unrest, and labor strikes are examples of events that can significantly impact the project and that are outside the control of the project team.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch11_s02_s04_p01">The project risk plan balances the investment of the mitigation against the benefit for the project. The project team often develops an alternative method for accomplishing a project goal when a risk event has been identified that may frustrate the accomplishment of that goal. These plans are called contingency plans. The risk of a truck drivers strike may be mitigated with a contingency plan that uses a train to transport the needed equipment for the project. If a critical piece of equipment is late, the impact on the schedule can be mitigated by making changes to the schedule to accommodate a late equipment delivery.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fwk-38087-ch11_s02_s04_p02">On one project, the project team left a section of a roof unfinished to allow the installation of equipment after the building was done and the roof installed. The equipment was late, and the project would have been delayed if the building was not completed. The project team left a section of the roof unfinished to allow the equipment to be placed in the building with the use of a crane. The roof was then completed, and the project finished on time.</p>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-38087-ch11_s02_s04_p03">In this example, the equipment arriving on time to meet the project schedule was considered a high risk. One option was to delay the end of the project. The team developed a contingency plan to install the roof in two phases to allow the installation of the equipment, if it was late. The contingency plan was more expensive and contingency funds were placed in the budget to cover the possibility that the equipment would be late.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch11_s02_s04_p04">Contingency funds are funds set aside by the project team to address unforeseen events that cause the project costs to increase. Projects with a high-risk profile will typically have a large contingency budget. Although the amount of contingency allocated in the project budget is a function of the risks identified in the risk analysis process, contingency is typically managed as one line item in the project budget.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch11_s02_s04_p05">Some project managers allocate the contingency budget to the items in the budget that have high risk rather than developing one line item in the budget for contingencies. This approach allows the project team to track the use of contingency against the risk plan. This approach also allocates the responsibility to manage the risk budget to the managers responsible for those line items. The availability of contingency funds in the line item budget may also increase the use of contingency funds to solve problems rather than finding alternative, less costly solutions. Most project managers, especially on more complex projects, will manage contingency funds at the project level, with approval of the project manager required before contingency funds can be used.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch11_s04_p01">Risk seems to have a positive correlation to complexity. High-risk projects are in most cases highly complex. The process of conducting a risk analysis focuses on understanding what can go wrong and the likelihood that it will go wrong. The project team then develops a project mitigation plan that addresses the items that were identified as high risk. The complexity analysis explores the project from the perspective of what elements on the project add to project complexity. The result of this analysis is the information needed by the project leadership to develop an appropriate execution plan. This execution plan also contains the risk management plan.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch11_s04_p02">Although increased complexity on a project increases the project risk profile, risk is only one component of the complexity profile, and the manageability of the risk is also reflected in the complexity level of the project. For example, the organizational component of the project may be extremely complex with decision making shared among several independent clients. The project management team will develop an execution plan that includes developing and maintaining alignment among the various clients. Although the organizational risk of the project decreases with the development of the execution plan, the organizational approach of the client did not change the complexity level of the project. If the Darnall-Preston Complexity Index (DPCI) is used to rate the project, high ratings in each category carry their own types of increased risks.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch11_s06_s01_p01">Planning for risks is a form of betting on the future. An accomplished gambler knows the odds of drawing a certain combination of cards in a poker hand or of a ball landing on a number at a roulette wheel. If a project has several risk factors, they are not likely to all occur on the same project, but it is important to know the odds of that happening and to compare them to the potential profit of the project. If several risks do materialize on the same project, it might cause the company to lose money on the project, and senior management must decide if the benefit is worth the risk.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch11_s06_s01_p02">Computers can generate random numbers that can be used to simulate the likelihood of combinations of risk factors occurring and the impact on the project’s profitability. These simulations calculate odds like those a gambler would use before placing a bet, and the process is named after a famous gambling center in Europe.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch11_s06_s01_p03">To use a Monte Carlo simulation, you have to decide how the frequency of occurrences is distributed. Three types of distributions are most common: normal, skewed, and equal. If they are governed by the central limits principle, the occurrences will have a normal distribution.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch11_s06_s01_p04">If the likely frequency of occurrences of a risk factor is more likely to be distributed to either side of the middle of the range, it is a skewed distribution.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch11_s06_s01_p06">A computer can choose numbers for each risk factor that represent a possible outcome for that risk on the project according to its distribution. Those numbers are fed into a spreadsheet that determines the effect on the project and its costs. This process is repeated thousands of times, and the result of each iteration—repeated process—is stored in a table of possible outcomes. This table is summarized in a histogram that shows how many of the iterations produced profit (or loss) in each range (bin).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch11_s06_s01_p07">The outcome of a Monte Carlo simulation gives managers an idea of how much the project could make or lose and the odds of that happening. Monte Carlo simulations are often used to predict the likelihood of a new product making a profit or loss. The same methods can be applied to predicting the profit or loss on a project.</p>
