    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s04_p01">High quality is achieved by planning for it rather than by reacting to problems after they are identified. Standards are chosen and processes are put in place to achieve those standards.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s04_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Measurement Terminology</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s04_s01_p01">During the execution phase of the project, services and products are sampled and measured to determine if the quality is within control limits for the requirements and to analyze causes for variations. This evaluation is often done by a separate quality control group, and knowledge of a few process measurement terms is necessary to understand their reports. Several of these terms are similar, and it is valuable to know the distinction between them.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s04_s01_p02">The quality plan specifies the control limits of the product or process; the size of the range between those limits is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">tolerance</a><span class="glossdef">Variation allowed on either side of the mean, often shown with the ± symbol to mean plus or minus.</span></span>. Tolerances are often written as the mean value, plus or minus the tolerance. The plus and minus signs are written together, ±.</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s04_s01_n01">
            <h3 class="title">Tolerance in Gasoline Production</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s04_s01_p03">The petroleum refinery chose to set its control limits for 87 octane gasoline at 86 and 88 octane. The tolerance is 87 ± 1.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s04_s01_p04">Tools are selected that can measure the samples closely enough to determine if the measurements are within control limits and if they are showing a trend. Each measurement tool has its own tolerances. For example, if a machine is making rods whose diameters should be 10 mm ± 0.01 mm, you need a measuring device that can accommodate a rod that is 10 mm wide but can measure that width to a much smaller tolerance than 0.01 mm, such as 0.001 mm.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s04_s01_p05">The choice of tolerance directly affects the cost of quality (COQ). In general, it costs more to produce and measure products that have small tolerances. The costs associated with making products with small tolerances for variation can be very high and not proportional to the gains. For example, it might double the manufacturing cost to improve a process from a 4 σ to a 5 σ (lower tolerances from 25 percent of control limits to 20 percent), which might only reduce the number of parts that are out of control from 4 per 100,000 to 6 per 10 million (see <a class="xref" href="fwk-38087-ch10_s01#fwk-38087-ch10_s01_s02_f04">Figure 10.4 "Meaning of Sigma Levels"</a>). The cost of failure of only 4 parts per 100,000 might be much less than the cost of prevention.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Defining and Meeting Client Expectations</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s04_s02_p01">Clients provide specifications for the project that must be met for the project to be successful. Meeting project specifications is one definition of a project success. Clients often have expectations that are more difficult to capture in a written specification. For example, one client will want to be invited to every meeting of the project and will then select the ones that seem most relevant. Another client will want to only be invited to project meetings that need client input. Inviting this client to every meeting will cause unnecessary frustration. Listening to the client and developing an understanding of the expectations that are not easily captured in specifications is important to meeting the client’s expectations.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s04_s02_p02">Project surveys that capture how the client perceives the project performance provide the project team with data that is useful in meeting client expectation. If the results of the surveys indicate that the client is not pleased with some aspect of the project, the project team has the opportunity to explore the reasons for this perception with the client and develop recovery plans. The survey can also help define what is going well and what needs improved.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s04_s03_p01">Planning for quality is part of the initial planning process. The early scope, budget, and schedule estimates are used to identify processes, services, or products where the expected grade and quality should be specified. Risk analysis is used to determine which of the risks the project faces could affect quality.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Techniques</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s04_s04_p01">Several different tools and techniques are available for planning and controlling the quality of a project. The extent to which these tools are used is determined by the project complexity and the quality management program in use by the client.</p>
        <div class="section" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s04_s04_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Quality Management Methodology</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s04_s04_s01_p01">The quality management methodology required by the client is used. The project manager must provide the documentation the client needs to prove compliance with their methodology. There are several different quality management methodologies, but they usually have characteristics that are similar to the ones described previously in the text.</p>

A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">flowchart</a><span class="glossdef">Diagram of processes that have branches and loops based on decisions.</span></span> uses standard symbols to diagram a process that has branches or loops.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s04_s04_s02_p02">The process used to plan and assess quality can be described using flowcharts. They are useful for communicating processes that have logical branches that can be determined by simple yes or no questions. Flowcharting is also useful for discovering misunderstanding in project roles and responsibilities and communicating responsibility for work processes.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s04_s04_s03_p01">When products like shoes were made by hand, artisans would seek some degree of standardization by marking standard lengths for different parts of the product on their workbench. In modern management practice, if a particular method or product is a standard of quality, comparing your organization’s quality plan to it is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">benchmarking</a><span class="glossdef">Comparison of practices to standards or best practices in the same industry.</span></span>. If a product or service is similar to something that is done in another industry or by a competitor, the project planners can look at the best practices that are used by others and use them as a comparison.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s04_s04_s04_p01">Because the cost of prevention is more often part of the project budget, the case must be made for increasing the project budget to raise quality. Some quality management programs, like Six Sigma, require that expenditures for quality are justified using a cost-to-benefit analysis that is similar to calculating the cost of quality, except that it is a ratio of cost of increasing quality to the resulting benefit. A cost-benefit analysis in some quality programs can take into account nonfinancial factors such as client loyalty and improvements to corporate image and the cost-to-benefit analysis takes the form of a written analysis rather than a simple numeric ratio. It is similar to determining the cost of quality (COQ).</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch10_s04_s04_s05_p01">Measuring for quality of manufactured products or use of repetitive processes requires taking samples. Specialists in quality control design a test regimen that complies with statistical requirements to be sure that enough samples are taken to be reasonably confident that the analysis is reliable. In project management, the testing experiments are designed as part of the planning phase and then used to collect data during the execution phase.</p>

This data can be collected using a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">check sheet</a><span class="glossdef">Form for recording the frequency of quality problems.</span></span>, which is a basic form on which the user can make a check in the appropriate box each time a problem occurs or by automating the data collection process using the appropriate technology. Once the data are collected, they can be analyzed by creating a type of frequency distribution chart called a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">histogram</a><span class="glossdef">Column chart that displays frequency of occurrence on the vertical axis.</span></span>. A true histogram is a column chart where the width of the columns fill the available space on the horizontal axis and are proportional to the category values displayed on the <em class="emphasis">x</em> axis, while the height of the columns is proportional to the frequency of occurrences. Most histograms use one width of column to represent a category, while the vertical axis represents the frequency of occurrence.</p>
