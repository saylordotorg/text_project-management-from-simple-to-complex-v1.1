            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch06_s02_s01_s01_p01">Even the most basic project will generate numerous documents using word processing software. A communications plan can specify standards for these documents that makes it easier to create, edit, combine, store, and retrieve the documents. Document standards include the following:</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch06_s02_s01_s01_s01_p01">Word processing software programs display a document on a computer’s screen and allow the user to enter and edit text. When the file is saved to a storage device, the text and all the various formatting such as font and font size are converted to a code for efficient storage. The code varies from one word processing program to another and even between releases of the same program.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch06_s02_s01_s01_s01_p02">The most common word processing program, by a wide margin, is Microsoft Word (MS Word). Several releases of MS Word run on the Windows operating system and on the Macintosh operating system. Versions of MS Word released prior to 2007 save files in a proprietary format. The format is indicated by a period and a three-letter extension—.doc—that is automatically attached to the file when it is saved. Beginning with MS Word 2007 for Windows and MS Word 2008 for Macintosh, files are saved using a different format that is indicated by a period and a four-letter extension—.docx—that identify the newer format.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch06_s02_s01_s01_s01_p03">Almost all word processing programs have the ability to save files in the .doc file format, and it is a common standard for word processing files. Newer versions of word processing programs, including MS Word 2007 and MS Word for Mac 2008, can save files in the older .doc format. There are new features in MS Word 2007—such as the ability to format citations in a variety of styles, including APA, MLA, and Chicago—that are lost when the file is saved in the .doc format. Older versions of MS Word can be adapted to read the newer .docx file formats by downloading and installing a compatibility program that is available at no cost from Microsoft’s Web site. Display of document file extensions is hidden by default in the Windows operating system. They can be displayed by turning off this feature. Instructions for displaying the file extensions are available from the operating system’s help menu. In the Windows Vista operating system, the option is found on the Control Panel, in Appearance and Personalization, in Folder Options, on the View tab, under Advanced Settings, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-38087-ch06_s02_s01_s01_s01_f01">Figure 6.8 "Displaying File Name Extensions"</a>.</p>

The Styles group in MS Word 2007 includes predefined styles for nine levels of headings. In addition to using different fonts, each heading is assigned a level of importance. A document that uses headings with assigned levels can be viewed in the Outline view, such as the book outline shown in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-38087-ch06_s02_s01_s01_s03_f01">Figure 6.11 "Outline View in MS Word 2007"</a>. In this view, the level of detail displayed in the outline is selected to display the first two levels of the outline. The headings and the hidden text associated with each heading can be moved by selecting and dragging headings from one location in the outline to another.</p>

The intersection of the rows and columns are cells into which numbers, text, dates, and formulas can be entered. The formulas can utilize values found in other cells and display the results in the cell in place of the formula. If the value in a cell to which the formula refers is changed, all the formulas that use that cell’s value are immediately recalculated.

                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch06_s02_s01_s02_s01_p01">If a spreadsheet is used to store data, such as a list of project activities or a list of expenses, it is prudent to arrange the data in some way that would be used by more sophisticated data management software. Most data management programs arrange data in such a way that each type of data is represented by a column with a label at the top and each row contains the specific data for one type of item. A collection of data arranged in rows and columns is a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">table</a><span class="glossdef">Group of data that is organized in rows and columns, where columns are types of data and rows are individual instances.</span></span>. For example, a list of expenses would be arranged so that individual expenses are recorded on each row, and each column would be a type of information related to the expenses, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-38087-ch06_s02_s01_s02_s01_f01">Figure 6.15 "Expenses Arranged in a Table in a Spreadsheet"</a>.</p>

There have been several releases of MS Excel that run on the Windows operating system and on the Macintosh operating system. Versions of MS Excel released prior to 2007 save files in a proprietary format. The format is indicated by a period and a three-letter extension—.xls—that is automatically attached to the file when it is saved. Beginning with MS Excel 2007 for Windows and MS Excel 2008 for Macintosh, files are saved using a different format that is indicated by a period and a four-letter extension—.xlsx—that identifies the newer format.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch06_s02_s01_s02_s02_p02">Almost all spreadsheet programs have the ability to save files in the .xls file format, and it is a common standard for spreadsheet files. Newer versions of spreadsheet programs, including MS Excel 2007 and MS Excel for Mac 2008 can save files in the older .xls format.

                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch06_s02_s01_s02_s03_p02">If one or more of the columns in a table contain labels, identification numbers, or other descriptions, those labels can be used to specify sorting and filtering options. For example, if the spreadsheet has a list of expenses, the rows of data can be sorted in decreasing or increasing value by one of the data types such as the due date or the amount of the expense. The display can be restricted—<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">filtered</a><span class="glossdef">Display is restricted to data that meets criteria.</span></span>—to display only those rows that meet criteria specified by the user. For example, the table could be filtered to display the expenses for a particular department that were incurred between two dates. This ability facilitates the preparation of monthly progress reports and budgets.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch06_s02_s01_s02_s03_p03">In MS Excel 2007, the sorting and filtering options are on the Data tab, in the Sort and Filter group under the Sort or Filter button. Once a filter is applied, option buttons are placed at the top of each column to facilitate changes in the sorting or filtering options. For example, the list of expenses shown in the previous figure can be sorted by the labels in the Category column and filtered to show only costs that are more than $20, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-38087-ch06_s02_s01_s02_s03_f01">Figure 6.16 "Sorting and Filtering in Microsoft Excel 2007"</a>.</p>

Because more sophisticated project management software uses a table design in which the first two columns are description and duration, a similar structure, in which those two columns are adjacent and in that order will make it convenient to transfer the list of activities in a low-complexity project into the project management software at a later date if the spreadsheet is not sufficient. In the duration column, use the following abbreviations:</p>

Similarly, charts and reports are updated automatically based on the new data. The most popular software for medium-complexity projects is Microsoft Project. If a project manager begins work on the project in the belief that it can be managed using a list of activities in a word processing program or in a spreadsheet, the list of activities and their durations can be copied and pasted, or imported, into the project management software’s table of activities, if the original document or spreadsheet was designed with that possibility in mind, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-38087-ch06_s02_s01_s05_f01">Figure 6.25 "List of Activities Transferred to a Project Management Program"</a>.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-38087-ch06_s02_s01_s06_p02">Word processing documents often contain data that could be aggregated and analyzed. Beginning with Microsoft Word 2007 and the .docx file format, it is possible to insert characters called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">tags</a><span class="glossdef">Labels that enclose text to describe how it is displayed or to give it meaning as data.</span></span> on either side of a particular section of a form or document and assign a data label. For example, the name of the supplier on an invoice could be enclosed between two tags: &lt;supplier&gt;Thompson Hardware&lt;/supplier&gt;. These tags resemble those used in the hypertext markup language (HTML) to identify how to display text on a Web page, but instead of telling a Web browser how to display the name of the supplier, it identifies Thompson Hardware as the supplier. These tags are can be created by following a set of rules called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">extensible markup language (XML)</a><span class="glossdef">Rules for defining tags that can identify text as data or for display purposes.</span></span>. Forms created using XML can be scanned for the content that is marked by tags. The data can be imported into a spreadsheet or database for analysis. Creating documents that use XML to identify data in the forms can be done using Microsoft InfoPath. An example that identifies key facts in a document that was prepared using InfoPath is shown in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-38087-ch06_s02_s01_s06_f01">Figure 6.27 "InfoPath Form with XML Tags"</a>. Because it takes extra effort to learn to use InfoPath, or a similar XML authoring program, and to create the forms, this approach is normally limited to complex and sophisticated organizations that have the need to manage large amounts of data.</p>
